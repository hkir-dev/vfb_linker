1	Title	1	1	Unc-4 acts to promote neuronal identity and development of the take-off circuit in the Drosophila CNS
2	Abstract	1	1	The Drosophila ventral nerve cord (VNC) is composed of thousands of neurons born from a set of individually identifiable stem cells.
3	Abstract	1	2	The VNC harbors neuronal circuits required to execute key behaviors, such as flying and walking.
4	Abstract	1	3	Leveraging the lineage-based functional organization of the VNC, we investigated the developmental and molecular basis of behavior by focusing on lineage-specific functions of the homeodomain transcription factor, Unc-4.
5	Abstract	1	4	We found that Unc-4 functions in lineage 11A to promote cholinergic neurotransmitter identity and suppress the GABA fate.
6	Abstract	1	5	In lineage 7B, Unc-4 promotes proper neuronal projections to the leg neuropil and a specific flight-related take-off behavior.
7	Abstract	1	6	We also uncovered that Unc-4 acts peripherally to promote proprioceptive sensory organ development and the execution of specific leg-related behaviors.
8	Abstract	1	7	Through time-dependent conditional knock-out of Unc-4, we found that its function is required during development, but not in the adult, to regulate the above events.
9	[Introduction]	1	1	Acceptance summary:
10	[Introduction]	2	1	This study by Lacin and colleagues is a fine example of leveraging genetic reagents to incisively study the role of a gene (in this case the transcription factor, Unc-4) in the development and function of neuronal lineages.
11	[Introduction]	2	2	The work is robust and beautifully illustrated, focused on two hemi-lineages.
12	[Introduction]	2	3	There is lots to like about this study, particularly the clear logic and rigorous application of genetic techniques designed to squeeze out as much specificity as possible.
13	[Introduction]	2	4	The authors provided a clear, and perhaps technically the, as yet, most rigorously demonstrated example.
14	[Introduction]	2	5	This is not a new concept, so the question is around novelty.
15	[Introduction]	2	6	Yet, this type of work needs to be done and appreciated.
16	[Introduction]	2	7	Its rigour is impressive and it makes it clear that to understand how combinations of transcription factors regulate cellular properties, which then combine to shape specific behavioural outputs, remains a complex and challenging task.
17	[Introduction]	3	1	Decision letter after peer review:
18	[Introduction]	4	1	Thank you for submitting your work entitled "Unc-4 acts to promote neuronal identity and development of the take-off circuit in the Drosophila CNS" for consideration by eLife.
19	[Introduction]	4	2	Your revised article has been evaluated by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.
20	[Introduction]	5	1	A consolidated review is attached.
21	[Introduction]	5	2	The authors will see that they need to do next to nothing before acceptance, except read the words of praise and highlight better a significant finding and deal with the minor comments.
22	[Introduction]	6	1	Summary and consolidated reviews:
23	[Introduction]	7	1	This report uses the powerful genetic tools of Drosophila to characterize the expression and function of the conserved Unc-4 transcription factor during the development of the adult CNS.
24	[Introduction]	7	2	They show that Unc-4 is expressed in about half of the hemilineages that generate the adult ventral nerve cord.
25	[Introduction]	7	3	They use hemilineage specific Gal4 lines to determine the lineage-specific function of Unc-4, finding lineage-specific LOF phenotypes in two hemilineages.
26	[Introduction]	7	4	In the 11A hemilineage Unc-4 is required for promoting cholinergic identity and suppressing GABA identity, although Unc-4 is not capable of repressing GABA identity when ectopically expressed in other hemilineages.
27	[Introduction]	7	5	Thus, this is a lineage-specific phenotype.
28	[Introduction]	7	6	Similarly, Unc-4 LOF in hemilineage 7B results in failure to innervate T2 leg neuropil and a highly specific flight take-off defect (no jump).
29	[Introduction]	8	1	Overall, the experiments are beautifully documented; the text is clearly written, and the conclusions are well supported.
30	[Introduction]	8	2	The positives of this paper are the importance of characterizing a highly conserved transcription factor, the quality of the experiments and conclusions, and the identification of an entry point for subsequent characterization of an adult flight "jump" neural circuit.
31	[Introduction]	8	3	The only negative, perhaps, is the lack of a single coherent story - which is the direct consequence of having lineage-specific phenotypes, and thus hard to avoid.
32	[Introduction]	9	1	There is lots to like about this study, particularly the clear logic and rigorous application of genetic techniques designed to squeeze out as much specificity as possible.
33	[Introduction]	9	2	The results are clear: that in different hemilineages Unc-4 regulates different aspects of development, cell specification, and function.
34	[Introduction]	9	3	While here the authors provided a clear, and perhaps technically the as yet most rigorously demonstrated example, this is not a new concept.
35	[Introduction]	9	4	So the question is around novelty.
36	[Introduction]	9	5	Regardless, it is important that this type of work is done.
37	[Introduction]	9	6	Its rigour is impressive and it makes it clear that to understand how combinations of transcription factors regulate cellular properties, which then combine to shape specific behavioural outputs, remains a complex and challenging task.
38	[Introduction]	9	7	Here, the discussion is helpful in highlighting the importance to consider the evolutionary timeline of anatomical-developmental features, such as the conserved ground-plan of neuroblasts relative to genes such as Unc-4 having been harness in the diversification of hemilineages.
39	[Introduction]	10	1	In summary, we see that the methodological and scientific rigour of this work allow the authors to interpret the data with clarity and decisiveness that would otherwise not be possible:
40	[Introduction]	11	1	a) on distinguishing that only some hemilineages have a clear (anatomical and functional) requirement for Unc-4;
41	[Introduction]	12	1	b) that for most that do require Unc-4 this is developmental rather than later/post-mitotic (it is not unlikely that neuron cell fate is occurring in at least two waves of specification: early spatial/temporal fate via transient cues, and then post-mitotic consolidation of fate via long-lasting gene expression programs (TF combinations).
42	[Introduction]	12	2	So this paper would be directly relevant to that big picture issue and this could be highlighted in copyediting with a well-crafted sentence);
43	[Introduction]	13	1	c) that Unc-4 is required for very different aspects in different lineage contexts;
44	[Introduction]	14	1	Together, demonstrated with such clarity, these observations help us think about how transcription factors shape nervous system development and function.
45	[Introduction]	15	1	Reviewer #1 Minor Comments:
46	[Introduction]	16	1	- The finding that removal of Unc-4 in post-mitotic neurons has no phenotype is very interesting; I would consider adding that finding to the Abstract and Discussion.
47	[Introduction]	17	1	- I think it is important to say whether you are mentioning larval hemilineages or both embryonic and larval hemilineages in the Introduction and Results.
48	[Introduction]	17	2	For example, does the term "individual hemilineages" refer to both embryonic and post-embryonic hemilineages?
49	[Introduction]	17	3	For example, the last paragraph of the Introduction mentions hemilineages multiple times without distinguishing embryonic and post-embryonic hemilineages.
50	[Introduction]	18	1	- Is it known whether the 7B neurons that project to the leg neuropil are direct premotor neurons?
51	[Introduction]	18	2	One of this lineage (A07f2) is directly premotor to Eve^+ motor neurons in the larva (Zarin et al., BioRx55007iv 2019 Table 3) so it would be nice to add this information for the adult neurons.
52	[Introduction]	19	1	- It is not clear from the text whether the Unc-4^+ hemilineages contain only Unc-4^+ neurons, or also contain some Unc-4^- neurons; please clarify.
53	[Introduction]	20	1	- It is also not clear whether all cholinergic neurons are Unc-4^+ or if some are Unc-4^-; please clarify.
54	[Introduction]	21	1	- Subsection “Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression”, please add a citation for the statement that lin7 (NB3-2) neurons are Eve^+.
55	[Introduction]	21	2	To my knowledge, the only lineages that are Eve^+ are 1-1, 3-3, 4-2, and 7-1.
56	[Introduction]	22	1	- Sometimes the Unc-4 gene is italicized and sometimes not, please be consistent.
57	[Introduction]	23	1	- Could add Skeath 1998 to the reference in the second paragraph of the Introduction.
58	[Introduction]	24	1	- The first paragraph of the subsection “Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7B neurons” says "see Materials and methods" but I can't find the data in the Materials and methods.
59	[Introduction]	25	1	- The first paragraph of the subsection “Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7B neurons” has a broken reference that needs correction.
60	[Introduction]	26	1	- I would appreciate a thin dashed line around the leg neuropil in the relevant figures.
61	[Introduction]	27	1	Reviewer #2 Minor Comments:
62	[Introduction]	28	1	I have only very minor points to raise:
63	[Introduction]	29	1	Correct "axion projections"
64	[Introduction]	30	1	Figure 2 - legend: there is some confusion with referring to panels E and F and then G and H.
65	[Introduction]	31	1	Figure 7: panels C and D to replace "o" with a proper zero.
66	[Introduction]	32	1	We thank for the reviewer for this suggestion.
67	[Introduction]	32	2	As suggested, we edited the Abstract and Discussion to reflect this point as shown below.
68	[Introduction]	33	1	Part of the edited Abstract:
69	[Introduction]	34	1	“Through time-dependent conditional knock-out of Unc-4, we found that its function is required during development, but not in the adult, to regulate the above events.”
70	[Introduction]	35	1	Part of the edited Discussion:
71	[Introduction]	36	1	“Similarly, pan-neuronal deletion of Unc-4 specifically in the adult did not lead to any apparent behavioral defect even though Unc-4 expression is maintained in all Unc-4^+ lineages throughout adult life, suggesting that Unc-4 function is dispensable in mature neurons after eclosion under standard lab conditions.
72	[Introduction]	36	2	Future work will be required to ascertain whether Unc-4 functions during adult life or in more than two of its expressing hemilineages during development.
73	[Introduction]	36	3	Nonetheless, our work shows that Unc-4 executes distinct functions in the 7B and 11A lineages.”
74	[Introduction]	37	1	We appreciate this point and have added the following sentence to address it and clarify that our study is based entirely on postembryonic hemilineages.
75	[Introduction]	38	1	Edit to the Introduction:
76	[Introduction]	39	1	“In this paper, we focus only on postembryonic hemilineages, which from this point on in the paper we refer to as hemilineages for simplicity.”
77	[Introduction]	40	1	We are aware of the recently published Zarin et al., 2019, eLife paper.
78	[Introduction]	40	2	It is possible that larval motif is retained in the adult CNS.
79	[Introduction]	40	3	Unfortunately, we do not have any data for or against a premotor function of 7B neurons in the adult.
80	[Introduction]	40	4	Future work will investigate whether 7B neurons synapses with jump related motor neurons such as TTMn and TLMn.
81	[Introduction]	41	1	We clarified this ambiguity by editing the Introduction as shown below:
82	[Introduction]	42	1	“Unc-4 expression in these hemilineages is restricted to postmitotic neurons and it appears to mark uniformly all neurons within a hemilineage during larval and adult life (Lacin et al., 2014; Lacin and Truman, 2016).”
83	[Introduction]	43	1	We edited the related Result section to indicate that Unc-4 marks half the cholinergic lineages as shown below:
84	[Introduction]	44	1	“We previously showed that all of the Unc-4^+ postembryonic hemilineages are cholinergic and that half of all cholinergic hemilineages (7 of 14) express Unc-4 in the VNC (Lacinet al., 2019).”
85	[Introduction]	45	1	We believe the reviewer meant 11B neurons from NB7-2.
86	[Introduction]	45	2	We added the references (Lacin and Truman, 2016; Lacin et al., 2019) that demonstrated Eve expression in postmitotic 11B neurons.
87	[Introduction]	46	1	We now italicized unc-4 throughout the text.
88	[Introduction]	47	1	We added the indicated reference.
89	[Introduction]	48	1	We thank to the reviewer for indicating this.
90	[Introduction]	48	2	We now created a subsection in the Materials and methods with a title “Lineage-specific GAL lines” to make it easier for the reader to identify these reagents.
91	[Introduction]	49	1	We corrected it.
92	[Introduction]	50	1	Demarcating the leg neuropils is a helpful suggestion.
93	[Introduction]	50	2	We outlined the leg neuropils in Figure 6 as suggested.
94	[Introduction]	51	1	We thank for the reviewer for catching these typos and errors.
95	[Introduction]	51	2	We have corrected all of them.
96	Introduction	1	1	How does a complex nervous system arise during development?
97	Introduction	1	2	Millions to billions of neurons, each one essentially unique, precisely interconnect to create a functional central nervous system (CNS) that drives animal behavior (Herculano-Houzel, 2009).
98	Introduction	1	3	Work over several decades shows that developmentally established layers of spatial and temporal organization underlie the genesis of a complex CNS.
99	Introduction	1	4	For example, during spinal cord development in vertebrates, different types of progenitor cells arise across the dorso-ventral axis and generate distinct neuronal lineages in a precise spatial and temporal order.
100	Introduction	1	5	The pMN progenitors are located in a narrow layer in the ventral spinal cord and generate all motor neurons (Tsuchida et al., 1994; Pfaff et al., 1996; Briscoe et al., 2000).
101	Introduction	1	6	Similarly, twelve distinct pools of progenitors that arise in distinct dorso-ventral domains generate at least 22 distinct interneuronal lineages.
102	Introduction	1	7	Within each lineage, neurons appear to acquire similar identities: they express similar sets of transcription factors, use the same neurotransmitter, extend processes in a similar manner and participate in circuits executing a specific behavior (Jessell, 2000; Alaynick et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2015).
103	Introduction	2	1	The adult Drosophila ventral nerve cord (VNC), like the vertebrate spinal cord, also manifests a lineage-based organization.
104	Introduction	2	2	The cellular complexity of the VNC arises from a set of segmentally repeated set of 30 paired and one unpaired neural stem cells (Neuroblasts [NBs]), which arise at stereotypic locations during early development (Doe, 1992).
105	Introduction	2	3	These individually identifiable NBs undergo two major phases of proliferation: the embryonic phase generates the functional neurons of the larval CNS, some of which are remodeled to function in the adult, and the post-embryonic phase generates most of the adult neurons (Truman and Bate, 1988; Truman, 1990; Prokop and Technau, 1991; Bossing et al., 1996; Schmid et al., 1999; Consoulas et al., 2002).
106	Introduction	2	4	The division mode within NB lineages adds another layer to the lineage-based organization of the VNC.
107	Introduction	2	5	Each NB generates a secondary precursor cell, which divides via Notch-mediated asymmetric cell division to generate two neurons with distinct identities (Spana and Doe, 1996; Skeath and Doe, 1998).
108	Introduction	2	6	After many rounds of such cell divisions, each NB ends up producing two distinct hemilineages of neurons, termed Notch-ON or the ‘A’ and Notch-OFF or the ‘B’ hemilineage.
109	Introduction	2	7	In this paper, we focus only on postembryonic hemilineages, which from this point on in the paper we refer to as hemilineages for simplicity.
110	Introduction	2	8	Within a hemilineage, neurons acquire similar fates based on transcription factor expression, neurotransmitter usage, and axonal projection (Truman et al., 2010; Lacin et al., 2014; Lacin et al., 2019).
111	Introduction	2	9	Moreover, neurons of each hemilineage appear dedicated for specific behaviors.
112	Introduction	2	10	For example, artificial neuronal activation of the glutamatergic hemilineage 2A neurons elicit specifically high frequency wing beating, while the same treatment of the cholinergic hemilineage 7B neurons leads to a specific take-off behavior (Harris et al., 2015).
113	Introduction	2	11	Thus, hemilineages represent the fundamental developmental and functional unit of the VNC.
114	Introduction	3	1	We previously mapped the embryonic origin, axonal projection pattern, transcription factor expression, and neurotransmitter usage of essentially all hemilineages in the adult Drosophila VNC (Truman et al., 2004; Truman et al., 2010; Lacin et al., 2014; Harris et al., 2015; Lacin and Truman, 2016; Shepherd et al., 2016; Lacin et al., 2019; Shepherd et al., 2019).
115	Introduction	3	2	Here, we leverage this information to elucidate how a specific transcription factor, Unc-4, acts within individual hemilineages during adult nervous system development to regulate neuronal connectivity and function, and animal behavior.
116	Introduction	3	3	Unc-4, an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional repressor, is expressed post-mitotically in seven of the 14 cholinergic hemilineages in the VNC: three ‘A’ -Notch-ON- hemilineages (11A, 12A, and 17A) and four ‘B’ -Notch-OFF- hemilineages (7B, 18B, 19B, and 23B) (Miller et al., 1992; Rovescalli et al., 1996; Lacin et al., 2014; Lacin et al., 2019; Nittoli et al., 2019).
117	Introduction	3	4	For four of the Unc-4^+ hemilineages (7B, 17A, 18B, and 23B), the neurons of the sibling hemilineage undergo cell death (Truman et al., 2010).
118	Introduction	3	5	For the remaining three (11A, 12A, and 19B), the neurons of the sibling hemilineage are GABAergic (Lacin et al., 2019).
119	Introduction	3	6	Unc-4 expression in these hemilineages is restricted to postmitotic neurons and it appears to mark uniformly all neurons within a hemilineage during development and adult life (Lacin et al., 2014; Lacin and Truman, 2016).
120	Introduction	4	1	We generated a set of precise genetic tools that allowed us to uncover lineage-specific functions for Unc-4: in the 11A hemilineage, Unc-4 drives the cholinergic identity and suppresses the GABAergic fate; in the 7B hemilineage, Unc-4 promotes correct axonal projection patterns and the ability of flies to execute a stereotyped flight take-off behavior.
121	Introduction	4	2	We also find that Unc-4 is expressed in the precursors of chordotonal sensory neurons and required for the development of these sensory organs, with functional data indicating Unc-4 functions in this lineage to promote climbing, walking, and grooming activities.
122	Results	1	1	In the absence of extant mutant alleles of unc-4 gene, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to engineer both null and conditional null alleles of unc-4 as well as GAL4 and split-GAL4 reporter lines of unc-4 in order to assess unc-4 function in the postembryonic CNS (Figure 1; see also Materials and methods).
123	Results	1	2	First, we generated the unc-4^FRT fly line in which we inserted two Flippase Recognition Target (FRT) sites in the same orientation flanking the 2^nd and 3^rd unc-4 exons as well as an attP site immediately 5’ to the second exon.
124	Results	1	3	We used this parental unc-4^FRT stock to generate all mutant lines and the GAL4/split GAL4 reporter lines.
125	Results	1	4	To generate the unc-4^null mutant line, we used Flippase (FLP) to excise the 2^nd and 3^rd exons of unc-4 in the germline, generating an unc-4 allele that lacks the homeodomain (Figure 1A,B).
126	Results	1	5	Molecular analysis confirmed the presence of the expected deletion and immunostainings revealed no detectable protein expression in the unc-4^null mutant (Figure 1C).
127	Results	2	1	To generate GAL4 and split GAL4 lines reporter lines of unc-4, we used Trojan-GAL4 system (Diao et al., 2015) to insert three different GAL4 exons - GAL4, GAL4-AD, and GAL4-DBD into the attP site of the unc-4^FRT line (DBD: DNA binding domain of GAL4; AD: activation domain of GAL4).
128	Results	2	2	When crossed to appropriate transgenes, each of these alleles faithfully recapitulated Unc-4 expression in the VNC and brain in the larval and adult CNS (Figure 1D-F and not shown).
129	Results	2	3	Each of these lines is also a null allele of unc-4, as the Trojan exons truncate the Unc-4 protein after its first exon.
130	Results	2	4	This conclusion is confirmed by the absence of detectable levels of Unc-4 protein in larvae hemizygous for unc-4^GAL4, unc-4^AD, and unc-4^DBD (not shown).
131	Results	2	5	Leveraging these transgenes, we tracked Unc-4 expression in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and found that Unc-4 is expressed in all progenitors of leg chordotonal neurons (also called sensory organ precursors [SOPs]) and head sense organs in the larvae as well as many adult sensory neurons including chordotonal and bristle sensory neurons in the leg and Johnston’s organ and olfactory neurons in the antenna (Figure 1G-H; Figure 1-figure supplement 1).
132	Results	3	1	To determine if we can use the unc-4^FRT line to ablate Unc-4 function in a lineage-specific manner, we used NB7-4 -GAL4 to drive UAS-linked FLP expression specifically in NB7-4 during embryonic stages in unc-4^FRT homozygotes (Lacin and Truman, 2016).
133	Results	3	2	NB7-4 gives rise to the Unc-4^+ 23B neurons (Lacin et al., 2014).
134	Results	3	3	This manipulation resulted in loss of Unc-4 expression specifically in 23B neurons, but no other lineage (Figure 1I), highlighting the ability of our system to ablate Unc-4 function in a lineage specific manner.
135	Results; Loss of Unc-4 results in defined behavioral defects	1	1	All loss of function unc-4 alleles we generated (null, AD, DBD, and GAL4) exhibited semi-lethality in the hemizygous or homozygous state, with many pharate adults failing to eclose from the pupal case.
136	Results; Loss of Unc-4 results in defined behavioral defects	1	2	Escaper unc-4 null flies emerged as adults with a frequency of 13% of the expected Mendelian rate.
137	Results; Loss of Unc-4 results in defined behavioral defects	1	3	Adult unc-4 null mutant males were fertile, but females were infertile.
138	Results; Loss of Unc-4 results in defined behavioral defects	1	4	Examination of unc-4 females revealed that they were impaired in egg laying and their ovaries were dramatically enlarged due to egg retention (not shown), a phenotype that may arise due to defective functioning of sensory neurons in the female reproductive tract, some of which express Unc-4 (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). unc-4 mutant adults also exhibited defects in VNC executed behaviors (Figure 2).
139	Results; Loss of Unc-4 results in defined behavioral defects	1	5	All unc-4 mutant animals manifested erect wings, and none could fly or jump (Figure 2A,C,I; Video 1). unc-4 mutant adults could walk but only in an uncoordinated manner as most failed a climbing assay (see methods) due to falling or being extremely slow (Figure 2G,I; Videos 2 and 3). unc-4 mutants also showed impaired grooming due to lack of coordination among legs, and they completely failed in executing three-leg rubbing (Figure 2E,I; Video 4), a characteristic behavior which requires coordination of three legs for cleaning (Phillis et al., 1993).unc-4^DBD-tub^AD driven unc-4 expression rescued the observed behavioral defects as well as the semilethality (Figure 2B,D,F,H; Videos 2-6).
140	Results; Loss of Unc-4 results in defined behavioral defects	1	6	These rescued animals, however, did not behave like wild type: they were still slow to take-off (Video 6) and still exhibited defects in three-leg rubbing (not shown).
141	Results; Loss of Unc-4 results in defined behavioral defects	1	7	To ensure that all observed defects were the result of loss of Unc-4 function, we introduced a BAC transgene that contains the unc-4 locus (Venken et al., 2010) into unc-4 mutant flies and observed essentially 100% rescue of all observed phenotypes (Figure 2I; also compare Videos 6 and 7).
142	Results; Loss of Unc-4 results in defined behavioral defects	1	8	Our findings, thus, clearly show that Unc-4 function is required for take-off, flight, climbing and grooming behaviors.
143	Results; Unc-4 function is required during development	1	1	Unc-4 is expressed in both the developing and adult nervous system.
144	Results; Unc-4 function is required during development	1	2	To determine if unc-4 related behavioral defects arise due to a role for Unc-4 during development or a later role for Unc-4 during adult life, we used the TARGET system (McGuire et al., 2004) to remove Unc-4 function at different time points by controlling the timing of FLP expression.
145	Results; Unc-4 function is required during development	1	3	We removed Unc-4 function starting from the embryo or from late pupal stages and assessed the resulting flies after two weeks (see the methods) for the erect wing, three-leg rubbing and climbing phenotypes.
146	Results; Unc-4 function is required during development	1	4	We observed that early embryonic removal of Unc-4 resulted in the same behavioral defects as seen in unc-4 mutants, but its removal in late pupal stages yielded flies that behaved like wild-type (not shown).
147	Results; Unc-4 function is required during development	1	5	Unc-4, therefore, functions during development to regulate this suite of specific behaviors.
148	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	1	1	Next, we wanted to determine whether Unc-4 functions within specific CNS or PNS lineages to control specific behaviors.
149	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	1	2	We used two GAL4 driver lines in conjunction with our unc4^F^RT line to remove Unc-4 function in both the CNS and PNS or just the CNS.
150	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	1	3	We used sca-GAL4 to remove Unc-4 function in both the CNS and PNS (Mlodzik et al., 1990) and dpn^EE- GAL4 to remove Unc-4 function only in the CNS (Yang et al., 2016; Figure 3A-H). sca-GAL4 removed most Unc-4 expression from the CNS, all of Unc-4 expression from the progenitors of chordotonal sense organs, and also Unc-4 expression in epithelial cells of the leg disc (Figure 3B,F). dpn^EE-GAL4 which is expressed specifically in CNS NBs (Emery and Bier, 1995; Yang et al., 2016) removed most Unc-4 expression from the CNS but left Unc-4 expression in leg discs largely intact (Figure 3C,G). sca-GAL4 mediated knock-out of Unc-4 function led to the same behavioral defects observed in unc-4 mutant animals: all had erect wings, failed to fly, and showed grooming and climbing defects (Table 1; Video 8).
151	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	1	4	By contrast, the dpn^EE-GAL4 mediated removal from the CNS gave a partial phenotype with the flies having erect wings, an inability to fly, and mild grooming defects (Table 1), but they performed well on the climbing assay scoring at the same level as controls (Table 1; Video 9).
152	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	1	5	These results suggest that Unc-4 related PNS deficits are responsible for the poor climbing performance, while both PNS and CNS deficits are responsible for grooming defects.
153	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	2	1	Due to the known role of the chordotonal organs in leg-related behaviors (Tuthill and Wilson, 2016), we asked if Unc-4 function in the chordotonal neurons is required for wild-type climbing behavior.
154	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	2	2	To do this, we used a chordotonal SOP-specific driver ato-GAL4 (Hassan et al., 2000) to remove Unc-4 function completely from chordotonal lineage (progenitors and neurons), while leaving Unc-4 expression in the CNS intact (Figure 3D,H). ato-GAL4 also unexpectedly removed Unc-4 expression in the epithelial cells of most leg discs (Figure 3H). ato-GAL4 mediated removal of Unc-4 function in chordotonal lineage and epithelial cells resulted in coordination defects in leg movements: we observed defects in three-leg rubbing (Table 1; Video 10) and walking (Videos 11 and 12).
155	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	2	3	We did not assess climbing behavior of the resulting flies because ato-GAL4 driven FLP expression impaired the negative-geotaxis behavior of control animals (presumably due to ato-GAL4 expression in the gravity sensing Johnston organ or its progenitor cells).
156	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	2	4	To assess walking, we challenged flies to walk horizontally in small-diameter tubes.
157	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	2	5	Control animals walked in a coordinated manner without falling, but unc-4 null mutants and ato-GAL4 >unc4 ^F^RT flies were slow and fell often (Videos 11 and 12; Figure 3I).
158	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	2	6	Thus, our results indicate that loss of unc-4 function in the leg discs, presumably in the chordotonal lineage, is required to drive proper leg-related behaviors, including three-leg rubbing, walking, and likely climbing.
159	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	3	1	To ascertain whether Unc-4 function during chordotonal organ development may underlie the observed behavioral defects, we assessed Unc-4 function on adult femoral chordotonal organ (feCO) neurons, the major chordotonal organ in the leg.
160	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	3	2	We visualized them in control and unc-4 mutant animals via iav-GAL4, which marks all chordotonal neurons in the adult (Kwon et al., 2010).
161	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	3	3	In control animals, feCO neuronal cell bodies are clustered and located proximally near the trochanter border; they extend dendrites in a stereotyped fashion (Figure 3J).
162	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	3	4	In the mutants, the cell bodies of many of the neurons were displaced across the femur (Figure 3K,L) and their bundled dendritic projections appeared to be disrupted as compared to controls; all of these defects were rescued with restored Unc-4 function (Figure 3M).
163	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	3	5	Of note, axonal projections of the FeCO neurons in the VNC of unc-4 mutant animals appeared like wild-type (not shown).
164	Results; Peripheral contributions to the unc-4 behavioral phenotypes	3	6	Unc-4, therefore, appears to regulate the patterning and dendritic projections of chordotonal neurons in the leg, with this function likely underlying the observed defects in three-leg rubbing, walking, and climbing.
165	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	1	1	The central expression of Unc-4 is striking because that seven hemilineages that express it are all cholinergic (Lacin et al., 2019).
166	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	1	2	To determine if Unc-4 function is required for the survival or proper differentiation of these neurons, we combined unc-4^DBD line with the ubiquitous tub^AD line to visualize all Unc-4^+ neurons in control and unc-4 mutant animals.
167	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	1	3	As shown in Figure 4A, we observed no gross defects in the number and position of Unc-4^+ neurons in the absence of Unc-4 function, indicating Unc-4 is not required for its own expression nor is it required for the survival of these neurons.
168	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	2	1	We then determined the neurotransmitter profile of these neurons in control and unc-4 mutant background by intersecting unc-4 split GAL4 lines with neurotransmitter specific split-GAL4 lines expressed in cholinergic, glutamatergic, or GABAergic neurons (Diao et al., 2015; Lacin et al., 2019).
169	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	2	2	We previously showed that all of the Unc-4^+ postembryonic hemilineages are cholinergic and that half of all cholinergic hemilineages (7 of 14) express Unc-4 in the VNC (Lacin et al., 2019).
170	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	2	3	To confirm this and visualize cholinergic Unc-4^+ neurons, we intersected unc-4^AD expression with the cholinergic neuronal driver ChAT^DBD (Figure 4B).
171	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	2	4	As expected, most Unc-4^+ neurons including neurons of all seven postembryonic hemilineages (identified based on location and axonal projection) in the control VNC were marked with the split-GAL4 combination of unc-4^AD-ChAT^DBD, confirming the cholinergic identity of the Unc-4^+ hemilineages.
172	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	2	5	In the unc-4 mutant VNC, the expression of this split-GAL4 combination appeared grossly normal and marked all seven Unc-4^+ postembryonic hemilineages, indicating that Unc-4 function is not necessary for the cholinergic fate of most (but not all, see below) neurons in these hemilineages.
173	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	3	1	The relationship of Unc-4 expression to the glutamatergic phenotype was determined by combining VGlut^DBD, which labels glutamatergic neurons, with unc-4^AD.
174	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	3	2	Here, unc-4^AD-VGlut^DBD driven GFP expression identified several glutamatergic Unc-4^+ motor neurons in thoracic and abdominal segments in addition to a few occasional interneurons in the thoracic segments (Figure 4C).
175	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	3	3	Based on their axon projections, these motor neurons were the MN1-5 neurons, that innervate the indirect flight muscles, as well as motoneurons to neck and haltere muscles and the abdominal body wall (Figure 4-figure supplement 1).
176	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	3	4	Most of these adult motoneurons come from remodeled larval motoneurons (Consoulas et al., 2002).
177	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	3	5	Comparison of the adult cells with unc-4^AD-VGlut^DBD expression in the larval VNC indicated that these are remodeled versions of larval U/CQ motor neurons, from NB7-1 while others are likely embryonic-born neurons from NB2-4 lineage (Figure 4-figure supplement 2).
178	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	3	6	In the VNC of unc-4 mutant adults, these motor neurons were still present and marked with unc-4^AD-VGlut^DBD, but they were disorganized and reduced in size (Figure 4C; the MN5 size: 283+/- 54 μm^2 in controls vs 94+/- 31 μm^2 in mutants; N = 10 and 14 cells, respectively).
179	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	3	7	Unc-4, thus, is expressed in embryonic-born remodeled adult motor neurons and functions to promote their growth.
180	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	4	1	Finally, we intersected unc-4^DBD with gad1^AD, a line that is expressed in all GABAergic neurons, to assess whether Unc-4 regulates GABA fate.
181	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	4	2	In control animals, we failed to detect any GABAergic Unc-4^+ neurons in the VNC (Figure 4D).
182	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	4	3	RNA in situ hybridization against gad1 and ChAT genes confirmed this and our previous published findings and showed that all Unc-4^+ postembyonic hemilineages in the VNC express ChAT mRNA but not gad1 mRNA (Figure 4-figure supplement 2).
183	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	4	4	In unc-4 mutants, however, unc-4^DBD-gad1^AD marked many neurons in the VNC (Figure 4D).
184	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	4	5	Presence of a BAC clone containing unc-4 locus reversed this expression pattern, significantly reducing the number of ectopic GABAergic neurons (Figure 4E).
185	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	4	6	We identified these cells as a subset of the cholinergic hemilineage 11A (Harris et al., 2015; Lacin et al., 2019; Shepherd et al., 2019) based on the following observations: (i) like 11A neurons, they reside in posterior and dorsal region of only T1 and T2 segments (Figure 4D), (ii) their axonal trajectories match that of the 11A neurons (Figure 4F-G), (iii) they express Nkx6, a marker for 11A neurons (Figure 4H), and (iv) they intermingle with Eve^+ 11B neurons, which are the sibling neurons of 11A neurons (Lacin and Truman, 2016; Lacin et al., 2019; Figure 4I).
186	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	5	1	To test whether the transformed 11A neurons in the unc-4 mutants are purely GABAergic or exhibit mixed GABAergic/cholinergic identity, we assayed them for the presence of ChAT and gad1 mRNA (Figure 4J) and found that 92 +/- 5% expressed gad1 mRNA, 2 +/- 4% expressed ChAT mRNA, and none co-expressed both (N = 93 cells, 5 CNSs).
187	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	5	2	Thus, most of these 11A neurons switch from a cholinergic to a GABAergic fate.
188	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	5	3	Moreover, most of these converted neurons show GABA production as well as the gad1 mRNA (Figure 4K).
189	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	5	4	Unc-4, thus, appears to act in 11A hemilineage to promote the cholinergic fate and repress the GABAergic fate.
190	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	5	5	Importantly, misexpression of Unc-4 in immature neurons GABAergic VNC lineages, such as 13A and 19A, throughout development did not, however, alter their GABAergic fate.
191	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	5	6	Consequently, Unc-4 is not a general repressor of the GABAergic fate (N = 5 animals; not shown).
192	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	6	1	11A neurons likely function in take-off behavior of flies (Harris et al., 2015; Kennedy and Broadie, 2018).
193	Results; Unc-4 and neurotransmitter expression	6	2	We could not investigate if the ectopic GABA fate observed in 11A neurons lead to any behavioral defect because we lacked a driver to remove Unc-4 only from this hemilineage.
194	Results; Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7b neurons	1	1	To determine if loss of Unc-4 function leads to defects in the anatomy of neurons in the Unc-4^+ hemilineages, we visualized them in both mutant and control flies.
195	Results; Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7b neurons	1	2	Unc-4 is expressed in hemilineages 7B, 11A, 12A, 17A, 18B,19B, and 23B.
196	Results; Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7b neurons	1	3	We used lineage-specific GAL4 lines built for this study (see methods) together with NB intersected reporter immortalization technique (Awasaki et al., 2014) to individually visualize the 7B, 12A, 18B, 23B hemilineages (Figure 5A-D).
197	Results; Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7b neurons	1	4	We also used the immortalization technique for the 11A and 19B neurons, but the anatomy was complicated by the presence of their surviving sibling hemilineages (not shown).
198	Results; Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7b neurons	1	5	We could not evaluate 17A neurons due to lack of reagents.
199	Results; Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7b neurons	1	6	The loss of Unc-4 function had no gross defect on neuronal projections with the notable exception of hemilineage 7B.
200	Results; Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7b neurons	1	7	These neurons exhibited altered projections into the leg neuropils in the absence of Unc-4 function (Figure 5A; see below).
201	Results; Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7b neurons	2	1	Lineage 7B neurons are present in all thoracic segments, but only neurons of the T2 segment innervate the leg neuropils (Shepherd et al., 2019).
202	Results; Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7b neurons	2	2	Using multicolor flip-out clones in wild-type animals (Nern et al., 2015), we found that many 7B neurons in T2 send ipsilateral projection to the T2 leg neuropil, others project into all of the contralateral leg neuropils, and others do not innervate the leg neuropil at all (Figure 6A; not shown).
203	Results; Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7b neurons	2	3	Of note, we found that the projections of 7B neurons into the ipsilateral leg neuropil have synaptic output sites, indicating that they communicate to other neurons to execute leg-related behaviors (Figure 6B).
204	Results; Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7b neurons	2	4	We used two different reporter immortalization strategies as well as MARCM approach to follow axonal projections of hemilineage 7B neuron in the absence of Unc-4 (see methods).
205	Results; Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7b neurons	2	5	All three gave the same result: loss of unc-4 severely reduced 7B projections into the ipsilateral leg neuropils and also reduced contralateral leg projections (Figure 6C-I).
206	Results; Unc-4 function is required for proper neuronal projections in 7b neurons	2	6	Unc-4, therefore, functions cell autonomously in 7B neurons to support their proper innervation of the leg neuropil.
207	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	1	1	The anatomical changes in the 7B neurons with the loss of Unc-4 function is paralleled by a deficit in take-off behavior.
208	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	1	2	Previous work showed that activation of 7B neurons elicits take-off behavior in decapitated flies (Harris et al., 2015).
209	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	1	3	We used ey-^AD;dbx^DBD driven FLP expression in unc4^FRT flies to remove Unc-4 specifically in 7B neurons (Figure 7A,B; Figure 7-figure supplement 1).
210	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	1	4	To test the take-off behavior of the resulting flies, we first assessed their response to banging the vial in which they are housed (Video 13).
211	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	1	5	Control animals responded to this stimulus by exhibiting a take-off behavior.
212	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	1	6	In contrast, 7B specific Unc-4 knock-out flies raised their wings in an apparent attempt to take off, but they failed to be airborne.
213	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	1	7	Some were able to take off after an unusual duration and multiple rounds of wing raise.
214	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	1	8	We then recorded the take-off behavior of these flies with a high-speed camera after eliciting escape response via visual stimuli (Williamson et al., 2018).
215	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	1	9	This analysis revealed that 7B specific Unc-4 knock-out flies process the visual stimulus, initiate the take-off behavior by adjusting their posture and raising their wings, but fail to extend their middle legs to cause lift off (Figure 7B,C; Video 14).
216	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	1	10	Interestingly, some of these flies initiated the flight by just wing flapping without any clear jump (Video 15).
217	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	1	11	These results demonstrate that hemilineage 7B specific removal of Unc-4 impairs take-off behavior.
218	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	2	1	The altered behavior seen in the flies that have lost Unc-4 function in their 7B neurons could result from the loss of function of a critical component in the take-off circuit or a mis-wiring of the cells to make novel connections that interfere with take-off.
219	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	2	2	For example, in C. elegans, loss of Unc-4 function alters locomotion behavior due to ectopic synaptic connections of Unc-4^+ neurons.
220	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	2	3	We investigated whether the observed take-off phenotype was due to the gain of a novel function for the 7B neurons by ablating them during development via expressing the apoptotic gene, head involution defective (hid) in NB3-2 (Bergmann et al., 1998).
221	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	2	4	The resulting animals behaved essentially identical as 7B specific unc-4 mutants (Video 16), indicating the impairment take-off behavior is due to the loss of 7B neuronal function.
222	Results; Unc-4 promotes the development of flight take-off circuit	2	5	Based on our findings, we conclude that Unc-4 acts in 7B neurons to promote their leg neuropil innervation, connections that are required for flies to use their legs properly during take-off.
223	Discussion	1	1	Using precise genetic tools, we dissected the function of the Unc-4 transcription factor in a lineage-specific manner.
224	Discussion	1	2	We found that within the PNS, Unc-4 function is needed for the proper development of the leg chordotonal organ and walking behavior; whereas in the CNS, Unc-4 dictates neurotransmitter usage within lineage 11A and regulates axonal projection and flight take-off behavior in lineage 7B.
225	Discussion	1	3	Below, we discuss three themes arising from our work: lineage-specific functions of individual transcription factors, an association of Unc4+ lineages with flight, and the lineage-based functional organization of the CNS in flies and vertebrates.
226	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	1	Seven neuronal hemilineages express Unc-4 in the adult VNC, but our phenotypic studies revealed a function for Unc-4 in only two of them: in the 11A hemilineage, Unc-4 promotes the cholinergic fate and inhibits the GABAergic fate, while in the 7B hemilineage, Unc-4 ensures proper flight take-off behavior likely by promoting the proper projection patterns of the 7B interneurons into the leg neuropil.
227	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	2	Why did we fail to detect a loss-of-function phenotype for Unc4 in most of the hemilineages in which it is expressed?
228	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	3	A few reasons may explain this failure.
229	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	4	First, our phenotypic analysis was limited: We tracked neuronal projection patterns and neurotransmitter fate, but not other molecular, cellular, or functional phenotypes.
230	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	5	Unc-4 may function in other lineages to regulate other neuronal properties we did not assay, such as neurotransmitter receptor expression, channel composition, synaptic partner choice, and/or neuronal activity.
231	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	6	In addition, as our analysis assayed all cells within the lineage, it would have missed defects that occur in single cells or small groups of cells within the entire hemilineage.
232	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	7	Second, Unc-4 may act redundantly with other transcription factors to regulate the differentiation of distinct sets of neurons.
233	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	8	Genetic redundancy among transcription factors regulating neuronal differentiation is commonly observed in the fly VNC (Broihier et al., 2004; Lacin et al., 2009).
234	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	9	Thus, while our research clearly identifies a role for Unc-4 in two hemilineages, it does not exclude Unc-4 regulating more subtle cellular and molecular phenotypes in the other hemilineages in which it is expressed.
235	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	10	Similarly, pan-neuronal deletion of Unc-4 specifically in the adult did not lead to any apparent behavioral defect even though Unc-4 expression is maintained in all Unc-4^+ lineages throughout adult life, suggesting that Unc-4 function is dispensable in mature neurons after eclosion under standard lab conditions.
236	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	11	Future work will be required to ascertain whether Unc-4 functions during adult life or in more than two of its expressing hemilineages during development.
237	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	12	Nonetheless, our work shows that Unc-4 executes distinct functions in the 7B and 11A lineages.
238	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	13	The Hox transcription factors, Ubx, Dfd, Scr, and Antp, have also been shown to execute distinct functions in different lineages in the fly CNS (Marin et al., 2012; Kuert et al., 2014), suggesting transcription factors may commonly drive distinct cellular outcomes in the context of different lineages.
239	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	14	What underlies this ability of one transcription factor to regulate distinct cellular events in different neuronal lineages?
240	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	15	The ancient nature of the lineage-specific mode of CNS development likely holds clues to this question.
241	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	16	The CNS of all insects arises via the repeated divisions of a segmentally repeated array of neural stem cells whose number, ~30 pairs per hemisegment, has changed little over the course of insect evolution (Thomas et al., 1984; Truman and Ball, 1998).
242	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	17	Within this pattern, each stem cell possessing a unique identity based on its position and time of formation.
243	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	18	Each stem cell lineage has then evolved independently of the others since at least the last common ancestor of insects, approximately 500 million years ago.
244	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	19	Thus, if during evolution an individual transcription factor became expressed in multiple neuronal lineages after this time, it would not be surprising that it would execute distinct functions in different neuronal lineages.
245	Discussion; Lineage -specific Unc-4 functions	1	20	The lineage-specific evolution of the CNS development in flies, worms, and vertebrates may explain why neurons of different lineages that share specific properties, for example, neurotransmitter expression, may employ distinct transcriptional programs to promote this trait (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013; Konstantinides et al., 2018).
246	Discussion; Unc-4 and flight – a unifying theme?	1	1	Although Unc-4 appears to have distinct functions in different lineages, we found that an association with flight is a unifying feature among most Unc4^+ interneuron lineages and motor neurons.
247	Discussion; Unc-4 and flight – a unifying theme?	1	2	All Unc-4^+ hemilineages in the adult VNC except the 23B hemilineage heavily innervate the dorsal neuropils of the VNC, which are responsible for flight motor control and wing/haltere related behaviors, including wing-leg coordination (Harris et al., 2015; Namiki et al., 2018; Shepherd et al., 2019).
248	Discussion; Unc-4 and flight – a unifying theme?	1	3	For example, hemilineages 7B, 11A, and 18B regulate flight take-off behavior and 12A neurons control wing-based courtship singing (Harris et al., 2015; Shirangi et al., 2016).
249	Discussion; Unc-4 and flight – a unifying theme?	1	4	In addition, most Unc-4^+ motor neurons are also involved with flight - these include MN1-5, which innervate the indirect flight muscles, as well as motor neurons that innervate the haltere and neck muscles, which provide flight stabilization (Figure 4C).
250	Discussion; Unc-4 and flight – a unifying theme?	1	5	Since Unc-4 is conserved from worms to humans, it is likely that Ametabolous insects, like silverfish, which are primitively wingless, also have unc-4.
251	Discussion; Unc-4 and flight – a unifying theme?	1	6	It has yet to be determined, though, whether in such ametabolous insects the same hemilineages express Unc-4, and hence this pattern was in place prior to the evolution of flight.
252	Discussion; Unc-4 and flight – a unifying theme?	1	7	This would suggest that there was some underlying association amongst this set of hemilineages that may have been exploited in the evolution of flight.
253	Discussion; Unc-4 and flight – a unifying theme?	1	8	Alternatively, Unc-4 may be lacking in these hemilineages prior to the evolution of flight but then its expression may have been acquired by these hemilineages as they were co-opted into a unified set of wing-related behaviors.
254	Discussion; Lineage-based functional organization of the nervous system	1	1	The adult fly VNC is composed of 34 segmentally repeated hemilineages, which are groups of lineally related neurons with similar features for example, axonal projection and neurotransmitter expression (Truman et al., 2004; Truman et al., 2010; Lacin et al., 2014; Harris et al., 2015; Lacin and Truman, 2016; Shepherd et al., 2016; Lacin et al., 2019; Shepherd et al., 2019).
255	Discussion; Lineage-based functional organization of the nervous system	1	2	These hemilineages also appear to function as modular units, each unit appears responsible for regulating particular behaviors, indicating the VNC is assembled via a lineage-based functional organization (Harris et al., 2015).
256	Discussion; Lineage-based functional organization of the nervous system	1	3	The vertebrate spinal cord exhibits similar organization: lineally-related neurons acquire similar fates (‘cardinal classes’) and function in the same or parallel circuits (Lu et al., 2015).
257	Discussion; Lineage-based functional organization of the nervous system	1	4	The similarity of the lineage-based organization in insect and vertebrate nerve/spinal cords raises the question whether they evolved from a common ground plan or are an example of convergent evolution.
258	Discussion; Lineage-based functional organization of the nervous system	1	5	Molecular similarities in CNS development between flies and vertebrates support both CNS’s arise from a common ground plan.
259	Discussion; Lineage-based functional organization of the nervous system	1	6	For example, motor neuron identity in both flies and vertebrates, use the same set of transcription factors: Nkx6, Isl, and Lim3 (Tsuchida et al., 1994; Pfaff et al., 1996; Thor and Thomas, 1997; Sander et al., 2000; Broihier and Skeath, 2002; Broihier et al., 2004).
260	Discussion; Lineage-based functional organization of the nervous system	1	7	Moreover, homologs of many transcription factors expressed in fly VNC interneurons, such as Eve and Lim1, also function in interneurons of the vertebrate spinal cord (Lilly et al., 1999; Moran-Rivard et al., 2001; Pillai et al., 2007; Heckscher et al., 2015).
261	Discussion; Lineage-based functional organization of the nervous system	1	8	Whether any functional/molecular homology is present between fly and vertebrate neuronal classes awaits comparative genome-wide transcriptome analysis and functional characterization of neuronal classes in the insect VNC and vertebrate spinal cord.
262	Materials and methods; Transgenic animals unc-4^FRT line	1	1	Via CRISPR and homology directed repair, we inserted two FRT sites at the same orientation into the first and third unc-4 introns so that FRT sites flank the second and third exons, which encode the homeodomain.
263	Materials and methods; Transgenic animals unc-4^FRT line; Guide RNAs	1	1	We used two guide RNAs to direct Cas9 activity to the first and third introns of unc-4. pCFD4 vector was used to generate tandem guide RNA expression platform with the following primers (Port et al., 2014).
264	Materials and methods; Transgenic animals unc-4^FRT line; Guide RNAs	1	2	Forward primer: TATATAGGAAAGATATCCGGGTGAACTTCGG ttttcggggtcccatgtgtgGTTTTAGAGCTAGAAATAGCAAG.
