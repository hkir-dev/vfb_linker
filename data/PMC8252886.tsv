1	Title	1	1	Visual Input into the Drosophila melanogaster Mushroom Body
2	Abstract	1	1	The patterns of neuronal connectivity underlying multisensory integration, a fundamental property of many brains, remain poorly characterized.
3	Abstract	1	2	The Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body-an associative center-is an ideal system to investigate how different sensory channels converge in higher order brain centers.
4	Abstract	1	3	The neurons connecting the mushroom body to the olfactory system have been described in great detail, but input from other sensory systems remains poorly defined.
5	Abstract	1	4	Here, we use a range of anatomical and genetic techniques to identify two types of input neuron that connect visual processing centers-the lobula and the posterior lateral protocerebrum-to the dorsal accessory calyx of the mushroom body.
6	Abstract	1	5	Together with previous work that described a pathway conveying visual information from the medulla to the ventral accessory calyx of the mushroom body, our study defines a second, parallel pathway that is anatomically poised to convey information from the visual system to the dorsal accessory calyx.
7	In Brief	1	1	Li et al. find that the dorsal accessory calyx of the Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body integrates visual input from the lobula and the posterior lateral protocerebrum.
8	INTRODUCTION	1	1	Sensory systems use different strategies to detect specific physical features of the outside world.
9	INTRODUCTION	1	2	For instance, the olfactory system contains many different types of sensory neuron that are each specialized in detecting a specific class of volatile chemicals.
10	INTRODUCTION	1	3	Through only two neuronal layers, olfactory information-the identity of an odor and its concentration-is relayed to higher brain centers (Leinwand and Chalasani, 2011).
11	INTRODUCTION	1	4	In contrast, the visual system contains far fewer types of sensory neuron, but through numerous neuronal layers, it relays a range of highly processed information-for instance, color, brightness, motion, and shape-to higher brain centers (Baden et al., 2020).
12	INTRODUCTION	1	5	Thus, higher brain centers have to integrate different types of processed information, bind that information into a coherent representation of the outside world, and use such representations to guide behavior (Yau et al., 2015).
13	INTRODUCTION	1	6	How higher brain centers achieve this feat remains largely unknown.
14	INTRODUCTION	1	7	This gap in our knowledge mainly stems from the fact that higher brain centers are formed by a large number of neurons and that the projection neurons conveying information from different sensory systems to these centers often remain poorly characterized.
15	INTRODUCTION	1	8	This makes it difficult to understand whether there are specific patterns of neuronal connectivity that enable multisensory integration and what the nature of these patterns are.
16	INTRODUCTION	1	9	Deciphering the fundamental neuronal mechanisms that underlie multisensory integration requires a model system such as the Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body, which consists of a relatively small number of neurons whose connections can be charted reliably.
17	INTRODUCTION	2	1	The Drosophila mushroom body is formed by ∼2,000 neurons-called the Kenyon cells-and has long been studied for its essential role in the formation of olfactory associative memories (Aso et al., 2014; Hige, 2018).
18	INTRODUCTION	2	2	The identity of the projection neurons that connect the olfactory system to the mushroom body-and the way Kenyon cells integrate input from these neurons-has been characterized in great detail, highlighting fundamental connectivity patterns that enable this higher brain center to represent olfactory information efficiently (Bates et al., 2020; Caron et al., 2013; Tanaka et al., 2012a, 2012b; Zheng et al., 2018).
19	INTRODUCTION	2	3	Evidence in Drosophila melanogaster shows that the mushroom body is more than an olfactory center, as it is also required for the formation of visual and gustatory associative memories (Liu et al., 1999; Masek and Scott, 2010; Vogt et al., 2014).
20	INTRODUCTION	2	4	However, the identity of the neurons that connect the mushroom body to other sensory systems remains poorly characterized.
21	INTRODUCTION	2	5	Thus, a first step toward understanding how the mushroom body integrates multisensory information is to identify such non-olfactory mushroom body input neurons and the genetic tools necessary to manipulate these neurons.
22	INTRODUCTION	3	1	The mushroom body receives its input through its calyx and sends its output through its lobes.
23	INTRODUCTION	3	2	The calyx-a morphologically distinct neuropil containing the synapses formed between projection neurons and Kenyon cells-can be divided into four, non-overlapping regions: one main calyx as well as three accessory calyces named the dorsal, lateral, and ventral accessory calyces (Aso et al., 2014; Yagi et al., 2016).
24	INTRODUCTION	3	3	The five output lobes-the α, α’, β, β’, and γ lobes-contain the synapses formed between Kenyon cells, mushroom body output neurons, and dopaminergic neurons (Aso et al., 2014).
25	INTRODUCTION	3	4	With respect to these input and output regions, Kenyon cells can be divided into seven distinct types (Aso et al., 2014).
26	INTRODUCTION	3	5	Of these seven types, five types-the α/β_c, α/β_s, α’/β’_ap, α’/β’_m, and γ_main Kenyon cells-extend their dendrites only into the main calyx and their axons along one or two lobes.
27	INTRODUCTION	3	6	Most of the neurons that project to the main calyx emerge from the antennal lobe, the primary olfactory center in the Drosophila brain.
28	INTRODUCTION	3	7	Thus, α/β_c, α/β_s, α’/β’_ap, α’/β’_m, and γ_main Kenyon cells receive input primarily from the olfactory system (Caron et al., 2013; Aso et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2018).
29	INTRODUCTION	4	1	In contrast, the two other classes of Kenyon cells do not extend their dendrites into the main calyx.
30	INTRODUCTION	4	2	Instead, the α/β_p Kenyon cells extend their dendrites into the dorsal accessory calyx-avoiding completely the main, lateral, and ventral accessory calyces-and their axons along the α and β lobes.
31	INTRODUCTION	4	3	Likewise, the γ_d Kenyon cells extend their dendrites exclusively into the ventral accessory calyx and their axons along the γ lobe (Aso et al., 2014; Vogt et al., 2016).
32	INTRODUCTION	4	4	Thus, both the α/β_p and γ_d Kenyon cells are anatomically poised to receive non-olfactory input.
33	INTRODUCTION	4	5	There is evidence suggesting that the ventral accessory calyx receives input from the medulla, a region of the optic lobe that specializes in processing brightness and color (Morante and Desplan, 2008; Vogt et al., 2016).
34	INTRODUCTION	4	6	Furthermore, a recent study suggests that the dorsal accessory calyx is a multisensory center that integrates input from multiple sensory pathways, including the olfactory, gustatory, and visual systems (Yagi et al., 2016).
35	INTRODUCTION	5	1	Here, we report a strategy that uses a combination of genetic tools-including transgenic lines that drive expression in few neurons and a photo-labeling technique used to identify individual neurons and their pre-synaptic partners-to characterize the input neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon cells.
36	INTRODUCTION	5	2	We identify two types of mushroom body input neuron that, together, form about half of the total input the α/β_p Kenyon cells receive in the dorsal accessory calyx.
37	INTRODUCTION	5	3	The first neuronal type-henceforth referred to as _LOPNs-consists of a neuron that projects from the lobula, a region of the optic lobe specialized in detecting visual features, such as shape and motion.
38	INTRODUCTION	5	4	The second type of neuron-henceforth referred to as _PLPPNs-consists of projection neurons that emerge from the posterior lateral protocerebrum, a brain region that receives input from the optic lobe (Otsuna and Ito, 2006; Keleş and Frye, 2017; Wu et al., 2016).
39	INTRODUCTION	5	5	Interestingly, _LOPN and _PLPPNs do not project to the ventral accessory calyx and do not connect to the γ_d Kenyon cells.
40	INTRODUCTION	5	6	Based on these findings, we conclude that there are two parallel pathways that convey visual information to the mushroom body: a pathway projecting from the medulla to the γ_d Kenyon cells and another pathway projecting from the lobula and posterior lateral protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon cells.
41	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	1	1	The dorsal accessory calyx is a neuropil formed from the synapses connecting ~90 α/β_p Kenyon cells to their input neurons (Figure 1A; Aso et al., 2014).
42	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	1	2	Using transgenic lines that drive expression specifically in the α/β_p Kenyon cells (the R85D07-GAL4_DBD, R13F02-GAL4_AD transgenic line also known as the MB371-GAL4) and transgenic lines that express a photo-activatable form of green fluorescent protein (GFP) or PA-GFP (a combination of the UAS-C3PA-GFP and UAS-SPA-GFP transgenic lines, henceforth referred to as UAS-PA-GFP), we photo-labeled individual α/β_p Kenyon cells similarly as described in a previous study (Aso et al., 2014; Datta et al., 2008; Ruta et al., 2010).
43	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	1	3	We found that individual α/β_p Kenyon cells extend on average 5 ± 1 claw-shaped dendritic terminals (n = 13) exclusively into the dorsal accessory calyx (Figures 1B and 1D) and project their axons along the α and β lobes (not depicted).
44	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	1	4	The overall morphology of α/β_p Kenyon cells is similar to the morphology of other types of α/β Kenyon cell; for instance, individual α/β_s Kenyon cells extend on average 6 ± 1 claw-shaped dendritic terminals (n = 12) exclusively in the main calyx (Figure 1C) and project their axons along the α and β lobes (not depicted).
45	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	1	5	It is worth noting that the claws formed by the α/β_p Kenyon cells are much smaller in diameter (1.8 ± 0.4 μm; n = 9 claws) than the claws formed by the α/β_s Kenyon cells (3.0 ± 0.4 μm; n = 10 claws; Figures 1B, 1C [white arrows], and 1E).
46	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	1	6	It is also worth noting that the border of the dorsal accessory calyx is looser than the compact and well-defined circular border of the main calyx.
47	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	1	7	Individual α/β_p Kenyon cells can extend dendrites further away from the core of the dorsal accessory calyx, resulting in an irregularly shaped calyx (Figure 1D).
48	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	1	8	Individual α/β_p Kenyon cells are morphologically distinct, much like the other Kenyon cells.
49	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	1	9	Thus, the α/β_p Kenyon cells resemble α/β_s and α/β_c Kenyon cells but also differ from them in one major way: the dendrites of the α/β_s and α/β_c Kenyon cells exclusively innervate the main calyx-a region known to receive most of its input from the olfactory system-whereas dendrites of the α/β_p Kenyon cells exclusively innervate the dorsal accessory calyx-a poorly characterized region of the mushroom body.
50	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	2	1	To identify neurons that project to the dorsal accessory calyx and connect to the α/β_p Kenyon cells, we used a targeted photo-labeling technique that was adapted from previously published techniques (Aso et al., 2014; Datta et al., 2008; Ruta et al., 2010).
51	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	2	2	In order to only photo-label the neurons projecting to the dorsal accessory calyx, and not the α/β_p Kenyon cells, we used a combination of transgenes that, in concert, drive the expression of PA-GFP in all neurons except the Kenyon cells (the N-Synaptobrevin-GAL4, MB247-GAL80, and UAS-PA-GFP transgenes); instead, Kenyon cells were labeled with the red fluorescent protein DsRed using the MB247-DsRed transgene (Figure 2A).
52	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	2	3	The brains of adult flies carrying all the aforementioned transgenes were dissected and imaged using two-photon microscopy (Figures 2B and 2C).
53	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	2	4	Guided by the expression of DsRed, we targeted the dorsal accessory calyx-which is clearly distinct from the main calyx-with high-energy light in order to photo-convert PA-GFP specifically in the neurons projecting to that area (Figure 2C, white dashed outline).
54	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	2	5	Upon photo-labeling, the somata of the neurons that express PA-GFP, and that project either dendrites or axons into the dorsal accessory calyx, were labeled (Figures 2D and 2E).
55	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	2	6	On average, 71 ± 22 neurons (n = 22) were photo-labeled.
56	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	2	7	The somata of these neurons are located in seven distinct clusters that are distributed across the brain (Figures 2A, 2D, and 2E).
57	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	2	8	On the anterior side of the brain, we found three clusters: one located near the antennal lobe (cluster AL containing 3 ± 3 neurons); one located in the optic lobe (cluster OL containing 1 ± 2 neurons); and one located near the anterior ventral lateral protocerebrum (cluster AVLP containing 6 ± 3 neurons; Figures 2D and 2F).
58	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	2	9	On the posterior side of the brain, we found four clusters: one located in the superior medial protocerebrum (cluster SMP containing 4 ± 2 neurons); one located in the superior lateral protocerebrum (cluster SLP containing 20 ± 8 neurons); one located in the lateral horn (cluster LH containing 34 ± 12 neurons); and one located in the posterior lateral protocerebrum (cluster PLP containing 3 ± 2 neurons; Figures 2E and 2F).
59	RESULTS; Neurons Projecting to the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Emerge from Different Brain Regions	2	10	Altogether, these results suggest that the dorsal accessory calyx receives input from a diverse and distributed collection of projection neurons that can be divided into seven clusters.
60	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	1	1	Although en masse photo-labeling of the neurons projecting to the areas within and around the dorsal accessory calyx gives a good approximation of the number of neurons possibly connecting to the α/β_p Kenyon cells, this technique cannot confidently identify true pre-synaptic partners.
61	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	1	2	Additionally, the amount of photo-activated PA-GFP within individual neurons varies significantly between trials, and because a large number of neurons project to the dorsal accessory calyx, it is difficult to resolve the morphology of individual neurons using this technique.
62	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	1	3	We, therefore, sought to identify GAL4 transgenic lines that drive expression specifically in these neurons.
63	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	1	4	To identify such lines, we carried out an anatomical screen using the FlyLight collection of GAL4 transgenic lines (Figure 3A; Jenett et al., 2012).
64	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	1	5	As a first step, we screened through the FlyLight database-an online catalog that reports the expression patterns of ∼7,000 GAL4 driver lines-and selected 267 transgenic lines that highlighted neuronal processes in the dorsal accessory calyx (Figures 3B and 3C).
65	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	2	1	As a second step, we specifically labeled neurons that project to the dorsal accessory calyx using the same technique as described above but with a different combination of transgenes (the R_line-GAL4, UAS-PA-GFP, and MB247-DsRed transgenes).
66	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	2	2	The brains of adult flies that carry this combination of transgenes were dissected and imaged using two-photon microscopy (Figures 3D and 3F).
67	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	2	3	Guided by the expression of DsRed, we targeted the dorsal accessory calyx with high-energy light in order to convert PA-GFP specifically in the neurons that project to that region (Figure 3D, white dashed outline).
68	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	2	4	We screened through the 267 pre-selected transgenic lines and identified 10 lines that we chose to investigate further based on two criteria.
69	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	2	5	First, we selected lines that showed a strong signal after photo-labeling and clear pre-synaptic terminals near or in the dorsal accessory calyx (Figures 3E and 3G; Table S1).
70	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	2	6	Possible pre-synaptic terminals-bouton-shaped (Figure 3E, white arrow)-were distinguished from possible post-synaptic terminals-mesh-shaped-based on the recovered photo-labeling signal.
71	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	2	7	Second, we selected lines based on the strength and specificity of their expression patterns: lines expressing at high level in a few neurons led to clear photo-labeling signals, making it easier to characterize these putative input neurons further (Figure 3G).
72	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	3	1	Finally, we determined whether the neurons identified with these lines are pre-synaptic partners of the α/β_p Kenyon cells.
73	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	3	2	To this end, we used an activity-dependent version of the GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners (GRASP) technique (Figure S1A; Feinberg et al., 2008; Macpherson et al., 2015).
74	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	3	3	In this technique, the GFP is split into two complementary fragments-the GFP1-10 and GFP11 fragments-that do not fluoresce when expressed alone; the GFP1-10 fragment is tagged to an anchor that specifically targets the pre-synaptic membrane (syb::spGFP1-10), whereas the GFP11 fragment is tagged to an anchor that targets the membrane (spGFP11::CD4).
75	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	3	4	When both fragments are in close contact-in this case, when the syb::spGFP1-10 fragment is released at an active synapse-GFP molecules can be reconstituted and recover their fluorescence.
76	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	3	5	The reconstitution of GFP molecules, as indicated by the presence of fluorescent GFP speckles, suggests that the neurons expressing the two complementary fragments form functional synapses (Macpherson et al., 2015).
77	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	3	6	In our study, the syb::spGFP1-10 fragment was expressed in the putative input neurons using the different transgenic lines identified in our screen as well as two transgenic lines that a previous study found to drive expression in putative dorsal accessory calyx input neurons (Figures S1B-S1M; Table S1; Yagi et al., 2016).
78	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	3	7	The expression of the spGFP11::CD4 fragment was driven in most of the Kenyon cells using the MB247-LEXA transgenic line.
79	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	3	8	We look for GFP speckles in the core of the dorsal accessory calyx, which is clearly visible in the red channel as an irregularly shaped structure anterior to the main calyx (Figure S1B, white dashed outline).
80	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	3	9	We detected a large number of GFP speckles in the core of the dorsal accessory calyx for four of the ten lines that were identified in the screen as well as for the two transgenic lines identified by the Yagi et al. (2016) study (Figures S1B-S1E, S1L, and S1M; Table S1).
81	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	3	10	Additionally, we detected a small number of GFP speckles in the same region for three other transgenic lines (Figures S1F-S1H; Table S1).
82	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	3	11	It is worth noting that some of the GFP speckles lay outside of the red signal; most likely, these speckles are formed by Kenyon cells that extend dendrites outside of the core of the dorsal accessory calyx (Figures S1B-S1H, S1L, and S1M).
83	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	3	12	Finally, we did not detect any GFP speckles for the remaining three lines (Figures S1I-S1K; Table S1).
84	RESULTS; Identification of Transgenic Lines Driving Expression in the Dorsal Accessory Calyx Input Neurons	3	13	Altogether, our screen identified at least nine transgenic lines that drive expression in neurons that form synapses with the α/β_p Kenyon cells of the dorsal accessory calyx.
85	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	1	To characterize further the morphology of the projection neurons that connect to the α/β_p Kenyon cells, we photo-labeled individual neurons using the transgenic lines recovered from our screen that showed reliable GRASP signal.
86	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	2	To this end, neurons were photo-labeled in the dissected brains of flies carrying the R_line-GAL4 and UAS-PA-GFP transgenes; these brains were then immuno-stained and imaged using confocal microscopy.
87	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	3	We first focused our attention on the transgenic lines in which we had found the strongest GRASP signal (Figures S1B-S1E; Table S1).
88	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	4	Photo-labeling of neurons that project to the dorsal accessory calyx using the R44H11-GAL4 and R72D07-GAL4 transgenic lines revealed a single neuron (Figure 4A).
89	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	5	In each line, a neuron projecting from the lobula to the dorsal accessory calyx was clearly photo-labeled (Figures 4B and 4C).
90	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	6	Therefore, we named this type of neuron “_LOPN.”
91	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	7	The soma of _LOPN is located in cluster PLP, a region medial to the optic lobe (Figures 2E, 4D, and 4E).
92	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	8	_LOPN extends its dendrites to the lobula and projects its axon to the superior lateral protocerebrum and the dorsal accessory calyx, completely avoiding the main calyx and the ventral accessory calyx (Figures 4D and 4E).
93	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	9	It is worth noting that _LOPN is very similar to the OLCT1 neuron that has been previously described using a different transgenic line, R95F09-GAL4; accordingly, we recovered a strong GRASP signal for that transgenic line (Figure S1L; Table S1; Yagi et al., 2016).
94	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	1	We then set out to confirm whether _LOPN does indeed connect to α/β_p Kenyon cells, as surmised from the GRASP results.
95	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	2	A previous study has demonstrated that a technique, which combines photo-labeling and dye-labeling tools, can be used to identify the complement of input that individual Kenyon cells receive from the antennal lobe and the frequency at which individual projection neurons connect to Kenyon cells (Caron et al., 2013).
96	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	3	We have modified this technique in order to directly measure the connectivity rate between a given projection neuron and Kenyon cells.
97	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	4	In this modified version of the technique, we used a combination of transgenic lines to photo-label the projection neuron of interest-using the same protocol that we described in the previous section-and to dye label a single Kenyon cell (Figure 5A).
98	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	5	We then assessed how many of the dendritic claws formed by the dye-labeled Kenyon cell are connected to a given projection neuron.
99	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	6	As a proof of principle, we measured the connectivity rate of the DC3 glomerulus projection neurons to the olfactory Kenyon cells that innervate the main calyx.
100	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	7	The connectivity rate of the DC3 projection neurons to the olfactory Kenyon cells has been previously approximated to be 5.1%; this means that there is a 5.1% chance that a given olfactory Kenyon cell claw receives input from the DC3 projection neuron (Caron et al., 2013).
101	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	8	Using the modified technique, we found that the DC3 projection neurons connect to Kenyon cells at a connectivity rate of 4.3% (n = 30), a value well within the range measured previously (data not shown).
102	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	9	We measured the connectivity rates of _LOPN to α/β_p Kenyon cells using the two transgenes we identified in our screen.
103	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	10	Using the R44H11-GAL4 driver line, we found that 4.1% (n = 27) of the claws formed by the α/β_p Kenyon cells connect to _LOPN (Figures 5B, 5C, and 5H; Table S1).
104	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	11	Likewise, using the R72H07-GAL4 driver line, we found that 3.0% (n = 27) of the claws formed by the α/β_p Kenyon cells connect to _LOPN (Figure 5H; Table S1).
105	RESULTS; _LOPN Connects the Lobula to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	12	Altogether, based on the results obtained using both the GRASP technique and the dye-/photo-labeling technique, we conclude that _LOPN is a true input neuron of the α/β_p Kenyon cells and that it conveys information from the lobula, a visual processing center, to the dorsal accessory calyx.
106	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	1	Photo-labeling of neurons that project to the dorsal accessory calyx using the R19H07-GAL4 and R20G07-GAL4 transgenic lines revealed a group of neurons (Figure 6A).
107	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	2	In each line, neurons that project from the posterior lateral protocerebrum to the dorsal accessory calyx were photo-labeled (Figures 6B and 6C).
108	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	3	Therefore, we named this type of neuron “_PLPPNs.”
109	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	4	The somata of the _PLPPNs are located in cluster LH, a region near the lateral horn (Figure 6D).
110	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	5	We could identify 13 ± 4 _PLPPNs (n = 21) and 6 ± 2 _PLPPNs (n = 2) per hemisphere using the R19H07-GAL4 and R20G07-GAL4 transgenic lines, respectively (Figures 6B and 6C).
111	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	6	All _PLPPNs extend projections into many brain centers, including the posterior lateral protocerebrum, the superior clamp, the superior lateral protocerebrum, and the dorsal accessory calyx, avoiding completely the main calyx and the ventral accessory calyx (Figure 6D).
112	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	7	Using the dye-/photo-labeling technique described above, we measured the connectivity rate between _PLPPNs and α/β_p Kenyon cells.
113	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	8	We found that the _PLPPNs identified using the R19H07-GAL4 transgenic line connect at a high rate: we found that 14.1% (n = 24) of the claws formed by the α/β_p Kenyon cells connect to the _PLPPNs (Figures 5D, 5E, and 5H).
114	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	9	We also measured the connectivity rate of individual _PLPPNs using the same transgenic line and found that, on average, an α/β_p Kenyon cell claw has 1.90% (n = 32) probability of connecting to a _PLPPN (Figure 5H; Table S1).
115	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	1	To determine whether the _PLPPNs identified in the R19H07-GAL4 and R20G07-GAL4 transgenic lines are the same or different types of neuron, we used the split-GAL4 technique (Luan et al., 2006).
116	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	2	In this technique, the GAL4 transcription factor is split into two complementary fragments-the GAL4_AD and GAL4_DBD domains-that are both transcriptionally inactive when expressed alone; when both fragments are expressed in the same cell, GAL4 can be reconstituted and recovers its transcriptional activity.
117	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	3	We found that 8 ± 3 _PLPPNs (n = 4) were visible in flies that carry the R20G07-GAL4_DBD and R19H07-GAL4_AD transgenes, thus confirming that both lines are expressed in the same group of _PLPPNs but that R20G07-GAL4_DBD might be expressed in a subset of _PLPPNs (Figures 6E-6G).
118	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	4	This result revealed, even more clearly, that individual _PLPPNs project in many different brain centers (Figure 6G).
119	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	5	In order to distinguish the axonal terminals from the dendritic arbors, we used the split-GAL4 combination of transgenic lines (the R20G07-GAL4_DBD and R19H07-GAL4_AD transgenic lines) to drive the expression of the pre-synaptic marker synaptotagmin in the _PLPPNs (Figure 6H).
120	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	6	We found that the projections extending into the superior lateral protocerebrum, superior clamp, and dorsal accessory calyx contain pre-synaptic terminals.
121	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	7	Similarly, when the expression of the post-synaptic marker DenMark was driven specifically in the _PLPPNs, we found that all of the projections made by the _PLPPNs contain post-synaptic terminals (Figure 6I).
122	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	8	However, the projections extending into the posterior lateral protocerebrum are the only projections formed by _PLPPNs that contain only post-synaptic terminals and no pre-synaptic terminals (Figures 6H and 6I).
123	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	1	To identify the neurons that project to the post-synaptic terminals formed by the _PLPPNs in the posterior lateral protocerebrum, a poorly characterized visual processing center, we used the targeted photo-labeling technique described above (Figure 7A).
124	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	2	In short, we used a combination of transgenes that, in concert, drive the expression of PA-GFP in all neurons (the N-synaptobrevin-QF and QUAS-PA-GFP transgenes) and the expression of tdTomato in the _PLPPNs (using the R19H07-GAL4_AD, R20G07-GAL4_DBD, and UAS-tdTomato transgenes).
125	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	3	Guided by the expression of tdTomato, we targeted the post-synaptic terminals formed by _PLPPNs in the posterior lateral protocerebrum with high-energy light (Figures 7B and 7C).
126	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	4	Upon photo-labeling, two types of neuron were clearly photo-labeled: the _PLPPNs-showing that the photo-activation was specific to these neurons-and neurons projecting from the ventral medulla (Figure 7D).
127	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	5	These photo-labeled neurons project into deeper layers of the medulla (Figure 7E).
128	RESULTS; _PLPPNs Connect the Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	6	Altogether, from this set of experiments, we conclude that _PLPPNs are one of the major input neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon cells and that they convey information from the posterior lateral protocerebrum, and possibly from the ventral medulla, to the dorsal accessory calyx.
129	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	1	Photo-labeling using the transgenic lines that displayed weak GRASP signal-these are the R30E11-GAL4, R31C03-GAL4, and R53B06-GAL4 lines-or no GRASP signal-these are the R11F07-GAL4, R11F08-GAL4, and R12C04-GAL4 lines-led to the identification of a third type of neuron (Figure S2).
130	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	2	The somata of these neurons are all located in the AL cluster, a region near the antennal lobe.
131	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	3	Although each of these neurons has a distinct overall morphology, they all project from the antennal lobe to the superior lateral protocerebrum and extend their axons in a region near the dorsal accessory calyx.
132	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	4	Therefore, we named this type of neuron “_ALPNs.”
133	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	1	The neurons photo-labeled using the R30E11-GAL4 and R31C03-GAL4 driver lines show a nearly identical morphology: in each line, a single neuron that extends its dendrites into the posterior antennal lobe and projects its axons into the superior lateral protocerebrum was visible (Figure S2A).
134	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	2	We named this neuron “_ALPN1.”
135	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	3	It is worth noting that _ALPN1 is very similar to the thermosensitive AC neuron that has been previously described (Shih and Chiang, 2011).
136	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	4	Using a combination of photo-labeling and dye-tracing techniques, as described above, we measured the connectivity rate between _ALPN1 and α/β_p Kenyon cells.
137	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	5	We could not detect any connections between _ALPN1 and α/β_p Kenyon cells (n = 26), suggesting that _ALPN1 is not a dorsal accessory calyx input neuron (Figure 5H; Table S1).
138	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	6	Similarly, the neuron photo-labeled using the R53B06-GAL4 line extends its dendrites into the column region of the posterior antennal lobe, a region known to be activated by high humidity, and the sub-esophageal ganglion, a gustatory processing center (Figure S2B).
139	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	7	We named this neuron “_ALPN2.”
140	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	8	Again, we could not detect any connections between _ALPN2 and α/β_p Kenyon cells (n = 30), suggesting that _ALPN2 is not a dorsal accessory calyx input neuron (Figures 5F-5H; Table S1).
141	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	9	Thus, _ALPN1 and _ALPN2 are most likely not contributing major input to the α/β_p Kenyon cells.
142	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	1	We extended our analysis to the transgenic lines that displayed no GRASP signal.
143	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	2	The neurons photo-labeled using the R11F08-GAL4 and R12C04-GAL4 driver lines show an overall similar morphology: in each line, a single neuron that extends its dendrites into the arm region of the posterior antennal lobe, a region known to be activated by low humidity, was visible (Figure S2D).
144	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	3	We named this neuron “_ALPN3.”
145	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	4	Not surprisingly, we could not detect any connections between _ALPN3 and α/β_p Kenyon cells (n = 26), suggesting that _ALPN3 does not provide input into the dorsal accessory calyx (Table S1).
146	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	5	Similarly, the neuron photo-labeled using the R11F07-GAL4 line extends its dendrites broadly throughout the anterior antennal lobe, an olfactory processing center (Figure S2F).
147	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	6	We named this neuron “_ALPN4.”
148	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	7	Again, we could not detect any connections between _ALPN4 and α/β_p Kenyon cells (n = 25), suggesting that _ALPN4 does not provide input into the dorsal accessory calyx (Table S1).
149	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	8	Thus, we could confirm that the transgenic lines that displayed no GRASP signal do not appear to provide major input to the α/β_p Kenyon cells.
150	RESULTS; _ALPNs Do Not Contribute Major Input to the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	9	Altogether, these results show that the third type of neuron identified in our screen-_ALPNs-project to a region close to the dorsal accessory calyx but are most likely not pre-synaptic to the α/β_p Kenyon cells.
151	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	1	Our results suggest that the _LOPN and _PLPPNs that we identified in our screen connect to the α/β_p Kenyon cells and that, together, these two types of projection neuron represent a large fraction of the input neurons of the dorsal accessory calyx.
152	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	2	Our results also suggest that the _ALPNs do not connect to the α/β_p Kenyon cells, as another study suggested (Yagi et al., 2016).
153	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	3	Thus, we conclude that the dorsal accessory calyx is anatomically poised to receive information primarily from the lobula and the posterior lateral protocerebrum, two visual processing centers.
154	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	4	We verified whether these findings corroborate with the recently released Drosophila hemibrain connectome (Xu et al., 2020).
155	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	5	Using the Neuprint 1.0.1 platform, we focused our attention on the 60 α/β_p Kenyon cells that have been reconstructed.
156	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	6	Altogether, these α/β_p Kenyon cells receive input from a large number of neurons, but most of these synapses are most likely axoaxonic synapses, as they are located along the α and β lobes.
157	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	7	These input neurons are primarily other Kenyon cells, various dopaminergic neurons, as well as neurons known to connect broadly to all Kenyon cells, such as the APL neuron and the DPM neuron (data not shown).
158	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	8	We focused our attention on the 133 input neurons that connect to the α/β_p Kenyon cells in the dorsal accessory calyx.
159	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	1	9	Not surprisingly, in accordance with the results obtained from our en masse photo-labeling experiment, the cell bodies of these input neurons can be divided into seven different clusters and the ratio of neurons belonging to a given cluster is largely consistent between both analyses (Figure S3A).
160	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	1	Interestingly, the LH cluster is the most numerous cluster: our study identified 34 ± 12 neurons (n = 22) in this cluster-including the 13 ± 4 _PLPPNs (n = 21)-whereas the connectome shows a total of 43 input neurons with cell bodies located in the lateral horn (Figure S3A).
161	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	2	Among these neurons, we identified 13 that, based on the location of their pre-synaptic and post-synaptic terminals, are morphologically similar to _PLPPNs (Figures 6J and 6K; Table S2).
162	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	3	We found that these _PLPPN-like neurons connect to 59 of the 60 reconstructed α/β_p Kenyon cells, representing 38.49% of the input all α/β_p Kenyon cells receive in the dorsal accessory calyx (Figure S3B; Table S2).
163	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	4	Interestingly, these neurons are divided into four types in the hemibrain connectome-although the basis for this categorization is not immediately clear-and individual α/β_p Kenyon cells do not receive preferential input from neurons within a type.
164	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	5	The fact that one of the transgenic lines we identified, R20G07-GAL4, is expressed in a subset of _PLPPNs suggests that there is a genetic basis for this categorization.
165	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	6	Based on the hemibrain connectome, we found that the 13 _PLPPNs receive input from 697 neurons, 207 of these neurons project from known visual centers (either the medulla, the lobula, or the optic glomeruli), and only 8 of these neurons project from the antennal lobe, supporting our assumption that _PLPPNs are primarily processing visual information (data not shown).
166	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	7	_PLPPNs-like neurons connect mostly to α/β_p Kenyon cells but also form a few connections to γ_d and γ_main Kenyon cells, reinforcing the observation that the dorsal accessory calyx input neurons and the ventral accessory calyx input neurons form two parallel pathways (Figure S3C).
167	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	8	Additionally, our study identified 1 ± 2 neurons (n = 22) in the OL cluster-including _LOPN-whereas the connectome shows a total of 4 input neurons with cell bodies located in the optic lobe (Figure S3A).
168	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	9	Among these neurons, we identified a neuron very similar to _LOPN (Figures 4F and 4G).
169	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	10	We found that this _LOPN-like neuron connects to 9 of the 60 reconstructed α/β_p Kenyon cells, representing 2.14% of the input all α/β_p Kenyon cells receive in the dorsal accessory calyx (Figure S3B; Table S1).
170	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	11	As we found in our study, this _LOPN-like neuron does not connect to any other types of Kenyon cell, forming a pathway parallel to the one conveying visual information to the ventral accessory calyx.
171	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	2	12	Interestingly, _PLPPNs and _LOPN share 75 common output neurons in the superior lateral protocerebrum, suggesting that other higher brain centers integrate input from this pathway.
172	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	1	Finally, both studies identified a number of neurons with cell bodies located near the antennal lobe: using en masse photo-labeling, we identified a total of 3 ± 3 neurons (n = 22) in the AL cluster, whereas seven such neurons are found in the connectome.
173	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	2	Among these neurons, we recognized three of the four _ALPNs we characterized: an _ALPN2-like neuron and an _ALPN4-like neuron that both represent 0.26% of the input that α/β_p Kenyon cells receive in the dorsal accessory calyx (Figures S2C, S2G, and S3B; Table S2).
174	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	3	We could not recognize an _ALPN1-like neuron in the connectome, but we identified an _ALPN3-like neuron (Figure S2E; Table S2).
175	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	4	The _ALPN3-like neuron does not connect to any Kenyon cells (Figures S2E and S3B).
176	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	5	Together, the seven antennal lobe input neurons-including the _ALPN2-like and _ALPN4-like neurons-represent less than 1% of the input that α/β_p Kenyon cells receive in the dorsal accessory calyx (Figure S3B).
177	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	6	Interestingly, most of the remaining input α/β_p Kenyon cells receive in the dorsal accessory calyx (15.14% of the total input α/β_p Kenyon cells receive in the dorsal accessory calyx) is from a single neuron projecting from many brain regions, including the main calyx and the pedunculus, two regions of the mushroom body, as well as the superior lateral protocerebrum (Table S2).
178	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	7	Altogether, these observations confirm that _LOPN-like and _PLPPN-like neurons are the major input neurons that connect to the α/β_p Kenyon cells in the dorsal accessory calyx.
179	RESULTS; _LOPN and _PLPPNs Are Major Input Neurons of the α/β_p Kenyon Cells	3	8	Thus, the dorsal accessory calyx receives most of its input from visual processing centers-the posterior lateral protocerebrum and the lobula-and is thus anatomically poised to process mostly, if not strictly, visual information.
180	DISCUSSION	1	1	In this study, we identified and characterized neurons projecting to the dorsal accessory calyx of the mushroom body and show that these neurons are pre-synaptic to the α/β_p Kenyon cells.
181	DISCUSSION	1	2	Using a combination of genetic and anatomical techniques, we could distinguish two different types of projection neuron: _LOPN projecting from the lobula-an area of the optic lobe processing visual features, such as shape and motion-and the _PLPPNs projecting from the posterior lateral protocerebrum.
182	DISCUSSION	1	3	Although the posterior lateral protocerebrum remains poorly characterized in D. melanogaster, evidence from other insects shows that this brain region receives input from the optic lobe (Paulk et al., 2008, 2009).
183	DISCUSSION	1	4	Interestingly, we found that the dendrites formed by the _PLPPNs in the posterior lateral protocerebrum are in close proximity to neurons that project from the ventral medulla.
184	DISCUSSION	1	5	Based on our results-and considering insights from the connectome-we estimate that _LOPNs and _PLPPNs account for half of total input that α/β_p Kenyon cells receive in the dorsal accessory calyx.
185	DISCUSSION	1	6	_LOPNs and _PLPPNs do not extend axonal terminals into the ventral accessory calyx, the other calyx known to receive visual input, but rather extend axonal terminals into the dorsal accessory calyx and into the superior lateral protocerebrum.
186	DISCUSSION	1	7	Likewise, the α/β_p Kenyon cells do not connect to the visual projection neurons that are associated with the ventral accessory calyx (Vogt et al., 2016).
187	DISCUSSION	1	8	These findings suggest that the visual system is connected to the mushroom body via two parallel pathways: the α/β_p Kenyon cells receive input from the lobula and the posterior lateral protocerebrum, whereas the γ_d Kenyon cells receive input directly from the medulla.
188	DISCUSSION	1	9	Further functional studies are necessary to determine what kind of visual information is processed by the α/β_p Kenyon cells.
189	DISCUSSION	2	1	In Drosophila melanogaster, the mushroom body has long been studied as an olfactory processing center.
190	DISCUSSION	2	2	However, evidence from many insects, including the honeybee Apis mellifera, shows that the mushroom body integrates sensory information across different modalities.
191	DISCUSSION	2	3	In honeybees, the input region of the mushroom body, also called the calyx, is divided into different layers, and each layer receives input from either the olfactory or visual system (Gronenberg, 2001).
192	DISCUSSION	2	4	Because the dendrites of Kenyon cells are also restricted to specific layers, it has been suggested that, in the honeybee, multisensory integration does not occur at the level of individual Kenyon cells but rather at the population level (Ehmer and Gronenberg, 2002).
193	DISCUSSION	2	5	Although the honeybee mushroom body differs greatly from the Drosophila mushroom body-it contains about a hundred times as many Kenyon cells and its input region is divided in multiple complex layers-it appears that both mushroom bodies share a common fundamental connectivity principle: the segregation of input based on sensory modality.
194	DISCUSSION	2	6	This connectivity mechanism is immediately apparent in the structural organization of the Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body: the Kenyon cells receiving input from the olfactory system all extend their dendrites into the main calyx, whereas the Kenyon cells receiving input from the visual system extend their dendrites either in the dorsal accessory calyx or the ventral accessory calyx.
195	DISCUSSION	2	7	Many studies have demonstrated that the Kenyon cells that process olfactory information-those associated with the main calyx-integrate input broadly across the different types of olfactory projection neuron (Caron et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2018).
196	DISCUSSION	2	8	Interestingly, it appears that the Kenyon cells that process visual information are wired differently.
197	DISCUSSION	3	1	We have a thorough understanding of how olfactory Kenyon cells integrate input from the antennal lobe: most Kenyon cells receive, on average, input from seven projection neurons, and the projection neurons connecting to the same Kenyon cell share no apparent common features (Caron et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2018).
198	DISCUSSION	3	2	Theoretical studies have shown that this random-like connectivity pattern enables the mushroom body to form sparse and decorrelated odor representations and thus maximizes learning (Litwin-Kumar et al., 2017).
199	DISCUSSION	3	3	Randomization of sensory input is a connectivity pattern that is well suited for representing olfactory information-as an odor is encoded based on the ensemble of olfactory receptors it activates-and might not be suitable for representing visual information.
200	DISCUSSION	3	4	Indeed, our results suggest that specific visual features-the signals processed by the medulla and the ones processed by the lobula and the posterior lateral protocerebrum-need to be represented by two separate subpopulations of Kenyon cells.
201	DISCUSSION	3	5	This observation mirrors anatomical studies of the honeybee brain: the neurons projecting from the lobula terminate in a different layer than the neurons projecting from the medulla (Ehmer and Gronenberg, 2002).
202	DISCUSSION	3	6	This arrangement might be essential to preserve distinct visual features when forming associative memories.
203	DISCUSSION	3	7	Functional and behavioral studies are required to determine whether indeed the mushroom body represents multisensory stimuli in this manner.
