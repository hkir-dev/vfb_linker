1	Title	1	1	Drosulfakinin signaling in fruitless circuitry antagonizes P1 neurons to regulate sexual arousal in Drosophila
2	Abstract	1	1	Animals perform or terminate particular behaviors by integrating external cues and internal states through neural circuits.
3	Abstract	1	2	Identifying neural substrates and their molecular modulators promoting or inhibiting animal behaviors are key steps to understand how neural circuits control behaviors.
4	Abstract	1	3	Here, we identify the Cholecystokinin-like peptide Drosulfakinin (DSK) that functions at single-neuron resolution to suppress male sexual behavior in Drosophila.
5	Abstract	1	4	We found that Dsk neurons physiologically interact with male-specific P1 neurons, part of a command center for male sexual behaviors, and function oppositely to regulate multiple arousal-related behaviors including sex, sleep and spontaneous walking.
6	Abstract	1	5	We further found that the DSK-2 peptide functions through its receptor CCKLR-17D3 to suppress sexual behaviors in flies.
7	Abstract	1	6	Such a neuropeptide circuit largely overlaps with the fruitless-expressing neural circuit that governs most aspects of male sexual behaviors.
8	Abstract	1	7	Thus DSK/CCKLR signaling in the sex circuitry functions antagonistically with P1 neurons to balance arousal levels and modulate sexual behaviors.
9	Abstract	2	1	P1 neurons integrate sensory cues to initiate male courtship in Drosophila.
10	Abstract	2	2	Here the authors identified inhibitory Drosulfakinin-expressing neurons that interact with P1 neurons in an experience-dependent manner, and oppositely regulate male sex drive.
11	Introduction	1	1	Animal behaviors are modulated by both internal states and external stimuli.
12	Introduction	1	2	When an organism is faced with more than one stimulus in the context of distinct behavioral states, multiple decision-making processes are involved in making appropriate behavioral choices.
13	Introduction	1	3	A fundamental question in neuroscience is to understand how neural circuits and molecular modulators control these decision-making processes.
14	Introduction	1	4	Significant progress has been made in identifying the molecules and neurons that control innate and social behaviors, such as courtship, sleep, feeding, and aggression in Drosophila [1-5] and mouse [6-9].
15	Introduction	2	1	Male courtship in Drosophila melanogaster is one of the best-understood innate behaviors, and largely controlled by the fruitless (fru) gene and doublesex (dsx) gene, which encode sex-specific transcription factors (FRU^M and DSX^M in males and DSX^F in females) [10-12].
16	Introduction	2	2	FRU^M is responsible for most aspects of male courtship [13-15], and DSX^M is important for the experience-dependent acquisition of courtship in the absence of FRU^M, and courtship intensity and sine song production in the presence of FRU^M  [16], [17].
17	Introduction	2	3	FRU^M is expressed in a dispersed subset of ca. 2000 neurons including sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons that are potentially interconnected to form a sex circuitry controlling sexual behaviors [14], [15], [18], [19].
18	Introduction	2	4	In contrast, DSX^M is expressed in ca. 700 neurons in males, the majority of which also express FRU^M, and are crucial for male courtship [20], [21].
19	Introduction	2	5	Recently, substantial progress has been made into how external sensory cues are perceived and integrated by fru^M and/or dsx^M neurons to initiate male courtship, in particular, how a subset of male-specific fru^M- and dsx^M-expressing P1 neurons integrate olfactory and gustatory cues from female or male targets to initiate or terminate courtship [22-26].
20	Introduction	2	6	Such a neuronal pathway is also conserved in other Drosophila species [27-29].
21	Introduction	3	1	Behavioral decisions depend on both excitatory and inhibitory modulations.
22	Introduction	3	2	P1 neurons represent an excitatory center that integrates multiple (both excitatory and inhibitory) sensory cues and initiates courtship [4], [24], [25].
23	Introduction	3	3	However, whether there is an inhibitory counterpart that operates against P1 neurons to balance sexual activity is still unknown.
24	Introduction	3	4	Indeed, males do not absolutely court virgin females even if these females may provide the same visual, olfactory, and gustatory cues, depending on the male’s internal states and past experiences.
25	Introduction	3	5	It has been previously shown that neuropeptide SIFamide acts on fru^M-positive neurons and inhibits male-male but not male-female courtship [30], [31], and SIFamide neurons also integrate multiple peptidergic neurons to orchestrate feeding behaviors [32], but whether SIFamide inhibits internal arousal states for sexual behaviors is not clear.
26	Introduction	3	6	Recently, we found that sleep and sex circuitries interact mutually and demonstrate how DN1 neurons in the sleep circuitry and P1 neurons in the courtship circuitry function together to coordinate behavioral choices between sleep and sex [33].
27	Introduction	3	7	However, we know very little on the inhibitory pathway(s) that may represent internal arousal states and inhibit courtship toward females.
28	Introduction	4	1	In this study, we set out to identify courtship inhibitory neurons that express neuropeptides in Drosophila, as neuropeptides play key roles in adjusting animal behaviors based on environmental cues and internal needs [34], [35].
29	Introduction	4	2	We identify the neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (DSK), the fly ortholog of Cholecystokinin (CCK) in mammals, functions through its receptor CCKLR-17D3 in the fru^M-expressing sex circuitry to inhibit male courtship toward females.
30	Introduction	4	3	We further demonstrate that Dsk neurons and P1 neurons interact and oppositely regulate male sexual behaviors.
31	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	1	1	We speculated that neuropeptides might function as molecular modulators in courtship circuit to control courtship behaviors, and screened for courtship deficit using 32 GAL4 lines driving the temperature-sensitive activator dTrpA1 [36] in distinct subsets of peptidergic neurons [37], [38] (Fig 1a, b).
32	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	2	1	This screen identified three GAL4 lines when combined with UAS-dTrpA1 at 30 °C severely impaired male courtship, including two Corazonin (Crz) GAL4 lines and a Drosulfakinin (Dsk) GAL4 line (courtship index [CI] < 20%, which is the fraction of observation time that males courted, Fig 1b).
33	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	2	2	Further analysis revealed that activating CrzGAL4 neurons [37], but not DskGAL4 neurons, induced rapid ejaculation in isolated males (Supplementary Table 1).
34	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	2	3	We also identified a Myoinhibitory-peptide (Mip) GAL4 line when combined with UAS-dTrpA1 at 30 °C mildly inhibited male courtship (CI~54%), but such inhibition was not consistent using two other Mip-GAL4 drivers (CIs > 80%, Fig 1b).
35	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	2	4	We also found that activation of neurons labeled by two SIFaGAL4 drivers did not affect male courtship toward females (CIs > 80%, Fig 1b), although it was previously shown that SIFamide neurons inhibit male-male courtship [30], [31].
36	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	2	5	Thus, we focused our further study on Dsk and Dsk-expressing neurons.
37	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	3	1	The above P-element based DskGAL4 labels a subset of Dsk-expressing neurons as well as a few non-Dsk neurons as revealed by GFP and anti-DSK (Supplementary Fig 1).
38	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	3	2	To further study the function of Dsk-expressing neurons, we generated the PhiC31-based site-specific DskGAL4, DskLexA, and DskFlp, using the 1.1 kb sequence upstream of the transcription start site of the Dsk gene as promoter.
39	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	3	3	The new DskGAL4 specifically labels four pairs of neurons in the medial protocerebrum, and weakly labels a few insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in the Pars Intercerebralis (PI) region (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig 2a), confirming a previous study [39].
40	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	3	4	Thus we used the new DskGAL4 hereafter.
41	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	3	5	Activation of these DskGAL4-labeled neurons via dTrpA1 severely impaired male courtship (CI~10%, Fig 1c, Supplementary Movie 1), while activating the Dsk-positive IPCs using dilp2GAL4 [40] did not affect courtship (CI > 80%, Supplementary Fig 2).
42	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	3	6	Furthermore, activating DskGAL4 neurons does not affect feeding, probably due to the weak labeling of IPCs (Supplementary Fig 3).
43	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	3	7	Silencing DskGAL4 neurons does not enhance the already high level of male courtship (CIs > 80%, Supplementary Fig 4).
44	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	4	1	To further confirm our findings, we used the optogenetic effector CsChrimson [41], which affords greater control over the dynamic range of neuronal activation than dTrpA1 [42], and found that optogenetic stimulation of Dsk neurons in UAS-CsChrimson-mVenus/DskGAL4 males almost abolished courtship such that 90% of males do not initiate courtship (CI~2%), dramatically different from all control males (CIs > 50%, Fig 1d).
45	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	4	2	Note that the empty GAL4 control flies also showed reduced courtship under red light, which may be due to genetic background and/or red light perturbation, and we used other control lines (e.g.
46	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	4	3	DskGAL4/+) in our later experiments.
47	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	4	4	We next assayed courtship in dark condition for 2 min to allow courtship (CI_1-2 ~ 40%), and then turned on red light for optogenetic activation.
48	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	4	5	We found that activation of DskGAL4 neurons immediately abolished courtship by males that already initiated courtship (Fig 1e).
49	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	4	6	Furthermore, we tested how much time such inhibition would last by assaying courtship in dark after 10 min in red light, and found that courtship was only partially restored after ~20 min (CI_1-10 is 1%, CI_11-20 is 4.8% and CI_21-30 is 43.6%, Fig 1f).
50	Results; Drosulfakinin-GAL4 neurons inhibit male courtship behavior	4	7	These results indicate that DskGAL4 neurons rapidly and efficiently inhibit male courtship and such inhibition lasts for a few minutes.
51	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	1	1	Analysis of the new DskGAL4 and DskLexA using a myr::GFP reporter revealed similar expression patterns, both of which label a subset of neurons in the brain that were previously identified as Dsk-expressing neurons [39], including four pairs of neurons in the medial protocerebrum (two pairs of MP1 and two pairs of MP3 cells), and a few IPCs (Fig 2a and Supplementary Fig 2a).
52	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	1	2	To further confirm these findings, we generated a polyclonal antibody raised against DSK (antigen: FDDYGHMRF, recognized two DSK peptides, DSK-1 and DSK-2), which faithfully labels MP1 and MP3 cells, and a number of interneurons in both the brain and the ventral nerve cord (Fig 2a), consistent with previous findings [39].
53	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	1	3	It should be mentioned that our DskGAL4 did not label neurons in the VNC.
54	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	1	4	It is possible that those antibody-labeled neurons in the VNC are not Dsk-expressing neurons, but the DSK antibody cross-reacts with other peptides in those neurons (e.g.
55	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	1	5	FMRFamide-related peptides).
56	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	1	6	Alternatively, those neurons in the VNC are indeed Dsk-positive, but the DskGAL4 only labels a part of Dsk-expressing neurons.
57	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	1	7	We observed no gross anatomy difference of Dsk neurons using both anti-GFP and anti-DSK between males and females (Supplementary Fig 5a), indicating that these Dsk neurons are not sex-specific.
58	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	1	8	Thus, we also activated DskGAL4 neurons using dTrpA1 (Supplementary Fig 5b) or CsChrimson (Supplementary Fig 5c) in females and observed significantly reduced receptivity to courting wild-type males.
59	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	1	9	These results indicate that Dsk-expressing neurons are common in both sexes and suppress male and female sexual behaviors, and we focused on male courtship in this study (but see below for their interaction with sex-specific neurons in both males and females).
60	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	2	1	Male courtship behavior is governed by neural circuitry comprised of ~2000 fru^M-expressing neurons [14], [15], [18], [19].
61	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	2	2	We asked if the courtship-inhibition neurons labeled by the DskGAL4 are a part of the fru^M circuitry.
62	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	2	3	Double labeling of fru^LexA and DskGAL4 neurons (LexAop-RedStinger/UAS-stinger-GFP; fru^LexA/DskGAL4) revealed that the four pairs of MP1 and MP3 neurons are all fru^M-positive (Fig 2b).
63	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	2	4	We then used an intersectional strategy [23] to visualize overlapped expression between fru^LexA and DskGAL4 (UAS > stop > myrGFP/+; LexAop2-FlpL fru^LexA/DskGAL4), but only observed stochastic MP1 and MP3 cells.
64	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	2	5	However, we observed consistent expression of MP1 and MP3 cells, as well as a number of IPCs, from intersection of fru^GAL4 and DskFlp (Fig 2c).
65	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	2	6	Further, we activated these overlapped neurons using the above optogenetic effector CsChrimson, and found that these males (UAS > stop > CsChrimson-mVenus/+; fru^GAL4/DskFlp) almost do not court (CI ~ 2%) under red light stimulation, while all control males court intensively (CIs > 70%, Fig 2d).
66	Results; Four pairs of Dsk and fru^M neurons inhibit male courtship	2	7	Together with the finding that IPCs are not involved in courtship suppression, these results demonstrate that two pairs of MP1 and two pairs of MP3 cells are Dsk- and fru^M-positive and responsible for courtship inhibition.
67	Results; Single-neuron labeling of the Dsk-expressing MP neurons	1	1	The four pairs of Dsk- and fru^M-expressing MP neurons project to various regions of the brain, but the morphology and function of individual neurons or neuronal types are unclear.
68	Results; Single-neuron labeling of the Dsk-expressing MP neurons	1	2	Thus we used heat-shock controlled flipase to stochastically label and activate subsets of DskGAL4 neurons in males (hs-Flp/Y; UAS > stop > CsChrimson-mVenus/+; DskGAL4/+).
69	Results; Single-neuron labeling of the Dsk-expressing MP neurons	1	3	These experiments revealed fine structures of individual Dsk neurons.
70	Results; Single-neuron labeling of the Dsk-expressing MP neurons	1	4	The two pairs of MP3 cells are indistinguishable and mainly project to the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP), the superior lateral protocerebrum (SLP) and the lateral horn (LH) [43] (Fig 3a labels a single MP3 neuron, and Fig 3b labels two MP3 neurons).
71	Results; Single-neuron labeling of the Dsk-expressing MP neurons	1	5	The two pairs of MP1 cells are distinct and termed as MP1a (Figs 3c, d label single MP1a neurons) and MP1b (Fig 3e labels a single MP1b neuron) hereafter.
72	Results; Single-neuron labeling of the Dsk-expressing MP neurons	1	6	The MP1a and MP1b cells project to various regions of the brain including the optic lobes (specifically from MP1a), suboesophageal ganglion (SOG) and the lateral protocerebral complex where the male-specific P1 neurons integrate multiple sensory cues and initiate courtship [18], [19].
73	Results; Single-neuron labeling of the Dsk-expressing MP neurons	2	1	Among the 103 males we assayed for courtship and later successfully imaged for CsChrimson-mVenus expression, 30 actively courted and 73 did not initiate courtship (for details, see methods).
74	Results; Single-neuron labeling of the Dsk-expressing MP neurons	2	2	The frequency of CsChrimson-mVenus expression in MP1a and MP1b neurons, but not MP3, is significantly higher in non-courters than that in courters (76.7% of non-courters vs. 70% of courters label the MP3 cell [p > 0.05]; 87.7% of non-courters vs.
75	Results; Single-neuron labeling of the Dsk-expressing MP neurons	2	3	63.3% of courters label the MP1a cell [p < 0.01]; 79.5% of non-courters vs.
76	Results; Single-neuron labeling of the Dsk-expressing MP neurons	2	4	13.3% of courters label the MP1b cell [p < 0.001], Fig 3b).
77	Results; Single-neuron labeling of the Dsk-expressing MP neurons	2	5	Indeed, MP1a and MP1b neurons, but not MP3 neurons, project to the lateral protocerebral complex that is important for courtship initiation.
78	Results; Single-neuron labeling of the Dsk-expressing MP neurons	2	6	Together these results illustrate the identity of individual MP cells, demonstrate their function in courtship inhibition, and suggest that the MP1a and MP1b cells may play more important roles then MP3 cells do in courtship inhibition.
79	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	1	1	It has been well established that the male-specific P1 neurons integrate chemosensory cues from potential mates and positively control male sexual arousal levels [6], [23-25], [42].
80	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	1	2	As Dsk neurons also project to the lateral protocerebral complex where inputs and outputs of P1 neurons both reside, we hypothesize that Dsk neurons may interact with P1 neurons to co-regulate sex and other arousal-related behaviors.
81	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	2	1	Firstly, we co-activated Dsk neurons and P1 neurons to test whether they function in a linear pathway where the downstream one may dominantly affect courtship.
82	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	2	2	We used three independent P1 drivers (R15A01GAL4, R71G01GAL4, or P1-splitGAL4) [23], [33], [42], and in all cases, we found that co-activation of Dsk and P1 neurons resulted in intermediate courtship levels compared to Dsk activation and P1 activation alone (Fig 4a).
83	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	2	3	These results indicate that Dsk and P1 neurons are not in a linear pathway, and they function antagonistically to modulate male courtship behavior.
84	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	3	1	Secondly, we tested how Dsk and P1 neurons may affect other arousal-related behaviors, e.g., sleep.
85	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	3	2	We found that activation of P1 neurons dramatically decreased male sleep as previously reported [33], [44], but activation of Dsk neurons did not significantly affect sleep.
86	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	3	3	However, we found that co-activation of Dsk and P1 neurons also resulted in intermediate sleep amounts (Fig 4b, c), indicating that Dsk neurons indeed function antagonistically with P1 neurons on the control of sleep, in addition to the control of sexual behaviors.
87	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	4	1	To further confirm these findings, we used video tracking on individual males to measure spontaneous walking activity for 24 h, and observed similar results.
88	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	4	2	Activation of P1 neurons alone promotes persistently high level of spontaneous walking for 24 h, while activation of Dsk neurons alone only mildly decreases spontaneous walking in the first hour, but does not significantly affect the average walking velocity for 24 h (Fig 4f-j).
89	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	4	3	Interestingly, we observed no difference between P1 activation and P1&Dsk co-activation males on their spontaneous walking activity during the first hour, but dramatic differences as activation proceeds, such that walking activity by P1&Dsk co-activation males is ~50% lower than P1 activated males, although still much higher than control males (Fig 4f-j).
90	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	4	4	These results clearly show that Dsk neurons function oppositely and persistently against P1 neurons on the control of spontaneous walking activity.
91	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	5	1	That activation of Dsk neurons mildly decreased spontaneous walking activity (at least initially) raises the possibility of a locomotion deficit.
92	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	5	2	To rule out such possibility, we assayed their locomotion providing external stimuli.
93	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	5	3	First, males with activated Dsk neurons walk and jump as quickly as control males when mechanically perturbed (Movie S2); second, males with activated Dsk neurons track rotating visual stimulus normally and walk as fast as control males in a visual-induced locomotion assay (Fig 4k-m).
94	Results; Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically regulate sexual arousal	5	4	That Dsk activated males rarely court females but normally track rotating visual stimulus further indicating that Dsk neurons negatively regulate an internal arousal state for sex and spontaneous walking, in opposite to the function of P1 neurons.
95	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	1	1	The above results demonstrate that Dsk and P1 neurons function oppositely to regulate internal arousal levels, but whether they interact with each other is unclear.
96	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	1	2	We registrated individual MP3, MP1a, or MP1b neurons (Fig 3a) with P1 neurons (labeled by P1-splitGAL4), and found that these MP neurons all have close contact with the P1 neurons (Fig 5a and Supplementary Movie 3-5).
97	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	1	3	Indeed, we observed substantial GRASP (GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners) [45] signal between Dsk and P1 neurons (Fig 5b), suggesting these neurons might have direct synaptic connection.
98	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	1	4	We then used the recently modified activity-dependent GFP reconstitution method [46].
99	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	1	5	This method uses GFP1-10 fragment fused to the presynaptic synaptobrevin (syb::spGFP1-10) and a membrane tethered version of the complementing split GFP (CD4::spGFP11), and GFP reconstitution is achieved only if there are vesicle fusion between neurons labeled by corresponding GAL4 and LexA drivers.
100	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	1	6	We first tested if Dsk neurons are presynaptic to P1 neurons by driving expression of syb::spGFP1-10 in DskGAL4 neurons and expression of CD4::spGFP11 in R15A01LexA labeled P1 neurons, and observed no GFP signal (Fig 5c, d).
101	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	1	7	As dsx^LexA labels much more neurons involved in male courtship including P1 neurons, we repeated such activity-dependent GRASP experiment using DskGAL4 and dsx^LexA, and did not observe any signal either (Fig 5e).
102	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	1	8	As a positive control to validate this technique, we observed substantial GRASP signal using pan-neuronal driver R57C10LexA (Fig 5f).
103	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	1	9	These results indicate that there is no direct synaptic connection from Dsk neurons to P1 neurons, but do not exclude the possibility that secreted DSK peptides might act on P1 neurons as long as there are DSK receptors expressed there.
104	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	1	10	In fact, P1 neurons do express DSK receptor, and could be regulated by DSK, but see below for details.
105	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	2	1	We then tested if P1 neurons might be presynaptic to Dsk neurons by driving expression of syb::spGFP1-10 in R15A01LexA labeled P1 neurons and expression of CD4::spGFP11 in DskGAL4 neurons, and observed reconstituted GFP signal specifically in the lateral protocerebral complex region (Fig 5g, h), indicating that P1 neurons form direct synaptic connections with Dsk neurons.
106	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	2	2	As such reconstituted GRASP signals are activity dependent, we compared these GRASP signals in males that have different housing experiences.
107	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	2	3	We found that synaptic transmission from P1 to Dsk neurons, represented by the intensity of GRASP signal, are much stronger in male-male group-housed conditions (11 males), compared to single-housed and male-female group-housed (1 male + 10 females) (Fig 5i).
108	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	2	4	These results not only providing evidence of direct synaptic transmission from P1 neurons to Dsk neurons, but also indicating that such synaptic transmission is experience dependent and more efficiently induced by male-male group housing.
109	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	2	5	We then tested the GRASP signal from all dsx neurons (including P1) to Dsk neurons (syb::spGFP1-10 driven by dsx^LexA and CD4::spGFP11 driven by DskGAL4), and observed much more GRASP signals where they were divided into three parts as ROI-1, ROI-2, and ROI-3 for statistics (Fig 5j, k).
110	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	2	6	Comparing the intensity of GRASP signals under the above three housing conditions, we found, in all ROIs, GRASP signals were significantly enhanced by housing a male with ten females, where only in ROI-2 (overlaps with GRASP signals that from P1 to Dsk, see Fig 5h) GRASP signals were significantly enhanced by male-male group housing, suggesting distinct properties of synaptic transmission from different dsx (e.g., P1 vs. pCd and pC2) neurons to Dsk neurons.
111	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	2	7	We tried LexA drivers labeling pCd (R41A01-LexA) or pC2 (R40F04-LexA), as well as many other neurons (we do not have clean drivers for pCd and pC2 yet), but did not observe any GRASP signal from these LexA labeled neurons to Dsk neurons, probably due to the weak labeling of pCd and pC2 neurons by these LexA lines.
112	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	2	8	Generating better genetic tools to label subsets of dsx neurons will help to understand how different populations of dsx neurons interact with Dsk neurons to regulate male courtship.
113	Results; Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons	2	9	Together these results indicate that Dsk neurons receive direct synaptic transmission, in an experience-dependent manner, from dsx neurons including P1 neurons.
114	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	1	1	The above results establish that four pairs of Dsk- and fru^M-expressing neurons function antagonistically with P1 neurons to regulate male courtship, but whether these Dsk neurons function through DSK peptides is unclear.
115	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	1	2	The Dsk gene encodes three mature peptides DSK-0, DSK-1 and DSK-2 (Fig 6a), two of which (DSK-1 and DSK-2) are Cholecystokinin (CCK)-like peptides [39], [47].
116	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	1	3	We generated two deletion alleles of Dsk using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique [48], [49], which we termed ∆Dsk^1 and ∆Dsk^2 (Fig 6a).
117	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	1	4	∆Dsk^1 leads to deletion of all three peptides, and ∆Dsk^2 only results in mutation of the DSK-2 peptide.
118	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	1	5	Indeed, we observed no anti-DSK signal in homozygous ∆Dsk^1 flies, and weaker signals in ∆Dsk^1/∆Dsk^2 flies, as the DSK antibody recognizes both DSK-1 and DSK-2 (Fig 6b).
119	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	1	6	These Dsk mutant males are fully viable and fertile, and court vigorously to females like control males (CIs > 80%, Fig 6c).
120	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	1	7	We also checked male-male courtship and did not observe obvious phenotype (Fig 6d).
121	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	1	8	These results indicate that loss of DSK in an otherwise wild-type fly does not obviously affect male courtship behaviors.
122	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	2	1	To determine whether release of DSK peptides from Dsk neurons is responsible for courtship inhibition, we activated Dsk neurons in the above Dsk mutant background.
123	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	2	2	We used homozygous ∆Dsk^1 males as the null mutant for all three DSK peptides, and its combination with ∆Dsk^2 as well as homozygous ∆Dsk^2 as specific mutants for the DSK-2 peptide.
124	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	2	3	We found that courtship inhibition by activation of Dsk neurons is fully dependent on secretion of DSK peptides, particularly the DSK-2 peptide, as loss of DSK-2 fully restores courtship of DskGAL4/UAS-dTrpA1 males at 30 °C (CI > 80%), comparable to wild-type courtship (Fig 6e).
125	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	2	4	These results indicate that DSK-2 is indispensable for courtship inhibition in males with Dsk neurons being activated, and further evidences are needed to reveal the role of DSK-1 in courtship inhibition.
126	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	2	5	Furthermore, we knocked-down Dsk using RNA interference (RNAi) [50], [51], which significantly decreased DSK immunoreactivity (Fig 6f, g), and found that courtship behavior was also restored in DskGAL4/UAS-dTrpA1 males at 30 °C (CI > 80%, Fig 6h).
127	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	2	6	We also found that activation of Dsk neurons in DskGAL4/UAS-TrpA1 males at 30 °C for 30 min decreased DSK immunoreactivity in many parts of Dsk neurons including soma, suggestive of DSK secretion in response to neuronal activation (Supplementary Fig 6).
128	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	2	7	Taken together these results demonstrated that DSK secretion from Dsk neurons is responsible for courtship inhibition in males with activated Dsk neurons.
129	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	3	1	As we did not observe increased courtship in Dsk mutant males, probably due to already high levels of male-female courtship or potential compensation to the loss of DSK modulation, we set out to test whether acutely increased expression of DSK in an otherwise wild-type fly would inhibit male courtship.
130	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	3	2	We utilized a newly invented technique using Cas9 transcriptional activators to activate gene expression [52], [53], and found that acutely over expression of Dsk two days before courtship assay, using temperature dependent tub-GAL80^ts, significantly decreased male courtship, compared to both genetic and temperature controls (Fig 6i).
131	Results; DSK peptides inhibits male courtship behavior	3	3	Together these results indicate that DSK peptides released from Dsk neurons inhibit male courtship behavior.
132	Results; DSK inhibits male courtship through its receptor CCKLR-17D3	1	1	DSK peptides have two G-protein coupled receptors: the CCK-like receptor (CCKLR) at 17D1 and 17D3 [54], [55].
133	Results; DSK inhibits male courtship through its receptor CCKLR-17D3	1	2	We found that Loss of CCKLR-17D1 using a deletion mutant Df(1)Exel9051 (∆17D1) did not restore courtship levels when activating Dsk neurons (Fig 7d).
134	Results; DSK inhibits male courtship through its receptor CCKLR-17D3	1	3	We then generated a deletion mutation of CCKLR-17D3 (∆17D3) by CRISPR/Cas9 tools [48], [49].
135	Results; DSK inhibits male courtship through its receptor CCKLR-17D3	1	4	This deletion removes the start codon and the coding sequence of CCKLR-17D3 (Fig 7a-c).
136	Results; DSK inhibits male courtship through its receptor CCKLR-17D3	1	5	We found that the courtship-inhibiting effect of activating Dsk neurons was abolished in ∆17D3 males (Fig 7d), indicating that DSK functions through its receptor CCKLR-17D3 but not CCKLR-17D1 to inhibit male courtship.
137	Results; DSK inhibits male courtship through its receptor CCKLR-17D3	2	1	To further confirm the role of CCKLR-17D3 on male courtship inhibition, we used the same technique [52], [53] as above activating Dsk expression to activate CCKLR-17D3 expression, and found that acutely over expression of CCKLR-17D3 two days before courtship assay significantly decreased male courtship behavior (Fig 7e).
138	Results; DSK inhibits male courtship through its receptor CCKLR-17D3	2	2	In contrast, over expression of CCKLR-17D1 did not significantly affect male courtship (Fig 7e).
139	Results; DSK inhibits male courtship through its receptor CCKLR-17D3	2	3	These results provide further evidence that DSK/CCKLR-17D3 signaling inhibits male courtship behavior.
140	Results; DSK/CCKLR-17D3 signaling responds to past experiences	1	1	In order to further understand the physiological role that DSK signaling plays, we measured the level of DSK and CCKLR-17D3 expression using quantitative real-time PCR, and found that DSK/CCKLR signaling responds to multiple physiological conditions, including re-feeding, aging, group-housing and P1 neuronal activation (Supplementary Fig 7).
141	Results; DSK/CCKLR-17D3 signaling responds to past experiences	1	2	Since we also found that group-housing enhanced synaptic transmission from P1 neurons to Dsk neurons according to the activity-dependent GRASP signals (see Fig 5i), we asked whether group-housing may affect male courtship in a DSK-dependent manner.
142	Results; DSK/CCKLR-17D3 signaling responds to past experiences	1	3	We first tested male-female courtship by single-housed males or group-housed males (11 males, the same as used in Fig 5i), and found no difference of male courtship in wild-type control males and Dsk knocked-down males (R57C10GAL4/UAS-DskRNAi) (Supplementary Fig 8a).
143	Results; DSK/CCKLR-17D3 signaling responds to past experiences	1	4	We then repeated male courtship, but tested in restricted conditions (headless females as targets under dark condition) to reduce redundancy of sensory stimulus on courtship [56], and found that group-housing significantly reduced male courtship under these conditions; however, such group-housing induced courtship reduction is not observed in Dsk knocked-down males, as they courted equally high under two rearing conditions (Supplementary Fig 8b).
144	Results; DSK/CCKLR-17D3 signaling responds to past experiences	1	5	These results indicate that DSK signaling responds to multiple physiological states and past experiences, and at least male-male group-housing experience increases DSK expression and reduces male courtship.
145	Results; CCKLR-17D3 in fru^M neurons inhibits male courtship	1	1	We showed that DSK functions in four pairs of fru^M-positive neurons to inhibit male courtship, and acts through its receptor CCKLR-17D3, but where CCKLR-17D3 functions to inhibit male courtship in unknown.
146	Results; CCKLR-17D3 in fru^M neurons inhibits male courtship	1	2	As we failed to generate a functional CCKLR-17D3 antibody, we made a knock-in GAL4 into the CCKLR-17D3 locus (17D3^GAL4) to recapitulate its expression (Fig 7f).
147	Results; CCKLR-17D3 in fru^M neurons inhibits male courtship	1	3	We found that 17D3^GAL4 drives expression broadly in the brain and the ventral nerve cord (Fig 7g).
148	Results; CCKLR-17D3 in fru^M neurons inhibits male courtship	1	4	To test whether 17D3^GAL4 drives expression in fru^M neurons, we used an intersectional strategy to label overlapping neurons between 17D3^GAL4 and fru^LexA.
149	Results; CCKLR-17D3 in fru^M neurons inhibits male courtship	1	5	Interestingly, the intersectional neurons include the male-specific P1 neurons that are crucial for courtship initiation, and the mushroom bodies that are important for sleep and locomotion, as well as many other neurons (Fig 7h, i).
150	Results; CCKLR-17D3 in fru^M neurons inhibits male courtship	1	6	That 17D3^GAL4 drives expression in P1 neurons is further confirmed by two other intersectional labeling experiments (Fig 7j, k).
151	Results; CCKLR-17D3 in fru^M neurons inhibits male courtship	1	7	Thus we have found a neuropeptide signaling that functions in the sex circuitry: Dsk MP neurons receive direct synaptic inputs from many dsx neurons including P1 neurons, and then act on many fru^M and/or dsx neurons (including P1) via secretion of DSK peptides to fulfill their function (Fig 7l).
152	Results; CCKLR-17D3 in fru^M neurons inhibits male courtship	1	8	To further test the role of CCKLR-17D3, we knocked down its expression using RNAi in all fru^M-expressing (fru^GAL4), all dsx-expressing (dsx^GAL4), or a subset of P1 neurons (P1-splitGAL4, ~10 pairs of P1 neurons), but found no difference for male courtship (Supplementary Fig 9a).
153	Results; CCKLR-17D3 in fru^M neurons inhibits male courtship	1	9	We then activated CCKLR-17D3 expression using above mentioned tools [53], [57] specifically in fru^GAL4, dsx^GAL4, or P1-splitGAL4 labeled neurons, and found that over expression of CCKLR-17D3 in all fru^M or dsx neurons, but not P1 neurons alone, significantly decreased male courtship (Supplementary Fig 9b).
154	Results; CCKLR-17D3 in fru^M neurons inhibits male courtship	1	10	These results indicate that CCKLR-17D3 functions in many fru^M and/or dsx neurons (at least more than ~10 pairs of P1 neurons) to inhibit male courtship.
155	Results; DSK signaling inhibits both male and female sexual behaviors	1	1	As we showed above that activating Dsk neurons also inhibited virgin female receptivity, we asked whether such inhibition in female sexual behavior depends on DSK/CCKLR-17D3 signaling.
156	Results; DSK signaling inhibits both male and female sexual behaviors	1	2	We found that suppression of female receptivity by activating DskGAL4 neurons also depends on DSK-2 and CCKLR-17D3 as loss of DSK-2 (UAS-dTrpA1/+; DskGAL4 ∆Dsk1/∆Dsk2, Supplementary Fig 10a) or CCKLR-17D3 (∆17D3; UAS-dTrpA1/+; DskGAL4/+, Supplementary Fig 10b) restores female receptivity to levels comparable to control females.
157	Results; DSK signaling inhibits both male and female sexual behaviors	1	3	Note that there is no P1 neuron in the female brain such that the P1-Dsk neuronal interaction is male-specific and does not account for female behaviors.
158	Results; DSK signaling inhibits both male and female sexual behaviors	1	4	As dsx neurons, particularly pC1 and pCd dsx neurons are important for virgin female receptivity [58], we tested whether dsx neurons have direct synaptic transmission to Dsk neurons, as found in males (Fig 5j-n).
159	Results; DSK signaling inhibits both male and female sexual behaviors	1	5	When syb::spGFP1-10 is driven by dsx^LexA and CD4::spGFP11 driven by DskGAL4, we observed substantial GRASP signals in a ring-like shape in the lateral protocerebral complex that are important for sexual behaviors, and some other regions in female brains (Supplementary Fig 10c).
160	Results; DSK signaling inhibits both male and female sexual behaviors	1	6	These results clearly show that Dsk neurons interact with sexually dimorphic dsx neurons in both sexes to suppress sexual behaviors.
161	Discussion	1	1	Our results identify, at single-neuron resolution, four pairs of fru^M-expressing Dsk neurons (MP1 and MP3) that suppress male and female sexual behaviors.
162	Discussion	1	2	The suppression of male and female sexual behaviors depends on the secretion of the neuropeptide DSK-2, which then acts on one of its receptors CCKLR-17D3 that is expressed in many fru^M neurons including P1 neurons and the mushroom bodies.
163	Discussion	1	3	Dsk neurons function antagonistically with courtship promoting P1 neurons to co-regulate male courtship, as well as sleep and spontaneous walking.
164	Discussion	2	1	Cholecystokinin (CCK) signaling appears well conserved over evolution and modulate multiple behaviors [47].
165	Discussion	2	2	In Drosophila, the CCK-like sulfakinin (DSK) is multifunctional and has been reported to be involved in regulating aspects of food ingestion and satiety [40], aggression [59], as well as escape-related locomotion and synaptic plasticity during neuromuscular junction development [55].
166	Discussion	2	3	In mammals, CCK generated from the intestine acts on its receptors in the nucleus of the solitary tract of the brain to transmit satiety signaling and thus inhibit feeding [60].
167	Discussion	2	4	Furthermore, CCK signaling in the nucleus accumbens modulates dopaminergic influences on male sexual behaviors in rats [61].
168	Discussion	2	5	CCK is also involved in nociception, learning and memory, aggression and depressive-like behaviors [62-64].
169	Discussion	3	1	Despite its significant and conserved roles in modulating multiple innate and learned behaviors, how CCK or DSK signaling responds to environment and/or internal changes, and acts on specific neurons expressing its receptors to modulate multiple behaviors, is still rarely known.
170	Discussion	3	2	Our finding that DSK/CCKLR signaling functions in the fru^M- and/or dsx-expressing sex circuitry to inhibit male courtship is an effort to use Drosophila as a model to investigate how this conserved signaling modulates animal behaviors.
171	Discussion	4	1	Our results uncovered a functional circuitry from many dsx neurons (including courtship-promoting P1 neurons) to four pairs of Dsk MP neurons via direct synaptic transmission, and these MP neurons then modulate CCKLR-17D3 neurons including many fru^M and/or dsx neurons via secretion of DSK peptides.
172	Discussion	4	2	It is of particular interest to reveal how the four pairs of MP neurons integrate sensory information (in any), physiological states and past experiences in the future to better understand how this neuropeptide signaling modulate arousal states.
173	Discussion	4	3	We still do not know if these MP neurons receive sensory inputs, but since they receive inputs from many dsx neurons including P1 neurons that integrate multiple chemosensory information [24], [25], these sensory inputs will at least relay to Dsk MP neurons via P1.
174	Discussion	4	4	Whether there are other pathways from sensory inputs to MP neurons awaits further study.
175	Discussion	4	5	We also note that multiple physiological changes including feeding states, aging and sleep deprivation, as well as past housing conditions affect expression of DSK/CCKLR-17D3, but how they affect DSK signaling and behaviors is still unclear.
176	Discussion	4	6	We showed that male-male group-housing increases DSK expression and thereby reduces male courtship at least under a restricted condition, and previous findings also revealed opposite effects of group-housing on the excitability of P1 neurons in males that have fru^M function or lack fru^M function [65], [66].
177	Discussion	4	7	Such male-male housing experience may mildly reduce sexual arousal in a persistent manner, perhaps by increasing DSK expression, but how such housing condition affects physiological roles of Dsk MP neurons and P1 neurons awaits further functional imaging studies on a potential P1-Dsk-P1 functional loop (and a much complex dsx-Dsk-17D3 pathway) with sensory stimulation under different physiological states.
178	Discussion	4	8	In terms of the time scale that DSK functions to inhibit male courtship, our results indicate an immediate behavioral effect upon Dsk neuronal activation.
179	Discussion	4	9	We also note that activation of Dsk neurons inhibits male courtship and lasts for minutes, and previous findings also showed that activation of P1 neurons promoted wing extension and aggression and lasts for minutes [42], [65].
180	Discussion	4	10	These persistent behavioral effects may represent persistent arousal states regulated by Dsk and P1 neurons in this study; however, how this persistency is generated both in the circuit level and behavioral level still needs further investigation.
181	Discussion	5	1	Dsk mutants do not have obvious courtship abnormality under our courtship assays.
182	Discussion	5	2	There are at least two possibilities: (1) DSK may function only in specific conditions (e.g., group-housing, as shown in Supplementary Fig 8) that increase its expression to inhibit courtship; and (2) There are redundant inhibitory signals for courtship, such as another neuropeptide SIFamide that acts on fru^M neurons [30], [31], although they specifically inhibit male-male courtship.
183	Discussion	5	3	Further studies on how DSK/CCKLR signaling is activated under certain conditions, as well as how DSK, SIFamide and other inhibitory signals (if any) jointly modulate male courtship are needed to fully understand this.
184	Discussion	5	4	Nevertheless, that courtship inhibition by activation of Dsk neurons depends on DSK/CCKLR-17D3 signaling, and increasing such signaling through Cas9 activators in an otherwise wild-type male efficiently inhibited courtship, unambiguously reveal the role of DSK/CCKLR-17D3 signaling in suppressing sexual behaviors.
185	Discussion	6	1	As DSK signaling modulates multiple behaviors, one may argue that its role in male courtship is not specific, e.g., activation of Dsk neurons may drive a competing behavior that phenotypically shunting male courtship.
186	Discussion	6	2	Although we cannot exclude such possibility, we listed a number of evidences as also summarized in Fig 8 to support DSK’s role with specificity in courtship inhibition: (1) DSK functions in four pairs of fru^M-expressing neurons to inhibit courtship; (2) males with activated Dsk neurons rarely court virgin females, while they follow rotating visual objects normally; (3) Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from courtship promoting P1 neurons (and many other dsx-expressing neurons) in an experience-dependent manner; (4) Dsk and P1 neurons antagonistically modulate sexual behaviors and wakefulness; and (5) DSK receptor CCKLR-17D3 inhibits male courtship and expresses in many fru^M and/or dsx neurons including P1 neurons.
187	Discussion	6	3	We note that CCKLR-17D3 is expressed broadly in the CNS including not only P1 neurons, but also mushroom bodies that regulate a range of behaviors including learning, locomotion and sleep [67].
188	Discussion	6	4	That DSK signaling is multifunctional is possibly due to broad expression of its receptors, and further studies on dissection of CCKLR function in subsets of neurons will help to understand how DSK/CCKLR signaling modulates multiple behaviors.
189	Discussion	7	1	The decision for male flies to court or not depends on not only environmental cues such as availability and suitability of potential mates (males, virgin females, or mated females), but also their internal states (e.g., thirsty or sleepy).
190	Discussion	7	2	We propose that there are at least four factors affecting such a decision: (1) external cues that inhibit courtship, referred to as Ex-In factor, such as the male-specific pheromone cVA [4]; (2) external cues that are excitatory for courtship, referred to as Ex-Ex factor, such as courtship song [68]; (3) internal states that inhibit courtship, referred to as In-In factor; and (4) internal states that are excitatory for courtship, referred to as In-Ex factor.
191	Discussion	7	3	These factors dynamically change and jointly determine males’ decision to court or not.
192	Discussion	8	1	Substantial progress has been made on how Ex-In and Ex-Ex factors jointly modulate the activity of male-specific P1 neurons, which is crucial for courtship initiation [23-25].
193	Discussion	8	2	In contrast, much less is understood on In-In and In-Ex factors.
194	Discussion	8	3	Recently, Zhang and colleagues found that dopaminergic modulation of P1 neurons drives male courtship not only by desensitizing P1 to inhibition, but also by promoting recurrent P1 stimulation [69], [70], thus may act as an In-Ex factor for male courtship.
195	Discussion	8	4	Note that all the three factors mentioned above converge on P1 neurons, making them a decision-making center for male courtship.
196	Discussion	8	5	The DSK/CCKLR signaling we identified in this study is of particular interest, as it is likely to act as an In-In factor for male courtship, and above all, it does not simply act on P1 neurons like three other factors, but instead forms a potential functional loop with P1 neurons and antagonizes P1 function in modulating male courtship and wakefulness.
197	Discussion	8	6	That Dsk neurons receive synaptic transmission from P1 neurons and other dsx-expressing neurons in an experience-dependent manner further highlights a central role that the DSK/CCKLR signaling plays.
198	Discussion	8	7	These factors, excitatory vs. inhibitory, external vs. internal, jointly control appropriate performance of sexual behaviors, and further studies will reveal how P1 and other dsx-expressing neurons physiologically interact with Dsk neurons to balance behavioral output.
199	Discussion	9	1	A prominent feature of the neuronal control of male and female sexual behaviors in Drosophila is that, despite large similarity in sensory systems, central integrative neurons are sex-specific in the two sexes, with dsx-expressing pC1 neurons integrating olfactory and auditory cues and promoting receptivity to courting males [58], and fru^M-expressing P1 neurons (largely overlapped with dsx-expressing pC1) integrating olfactory, gustatory, and auditory cues and promoting courtship to females [24], [25], [68].
200	Discussion	9	2	In contrast, the four pairs of Dsk-expressing MP neurons we investigated in this study are sexually monomorphic and inhibit both male courtship and female receptivity.
201	Discussion	9	3	Thus DSK/CCKLR signaling may inhibit sexual behaviors in response to physiological changes that are common to both sexes, while sex-promoting central neurons integrating distinct sensory cues are sexually dimorphic.
202	Discussion	9	4	Interestingly, these Dsk neurons common to both sexes receive synaptic transmission from sexually dimorphic dsx neurons in both males and females, providing a simple solution to link sex-specific excitatory and sexually non-specific inhibitory control of sexual behaviors in males and females.
