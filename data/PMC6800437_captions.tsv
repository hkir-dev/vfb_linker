54	figure	Fig. 8	1	A model of DSK signaling regulating male sexual arousal.
55	figure	Fig. 8	2	On one hand, male-specific P1 neurons that express both FRUM and DSXM integrate multiple sensory cues including both excitatory (e.g. from virgin females) and inhibitory (e.g. from males) information for courtship, and activation of P1 neurons persistently promotes male sexual behavior and wakefulness (reduction of sleep and increase of spontaneous walking), indicative of increased sexual arousal.
56	figure	Fig. 8	3	On the other hand, four pairs of Dsk- and fruM-expressing neurons interact with P1 neurons to form a potential functional loop, and act through DSK/CCKLR-17D3 signaling in fruM circuitry to persistently inhibit male sexual behavior and wakefulness.
