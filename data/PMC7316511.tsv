1	Title	1	1	Controlling motor neurons of every muscle for fly proboscis reaching
2	Abstract	1	1	We describe the anatomy of all the primary motor neurons in the fly proboscis and characterize their contributions to its diverse reaching movements.
3	Abstract	1	2	Pairing this behavior with the wealth of Drosophila’s genetic tools offers the possibility to study motor control at single-neuron resolution, and soon throughout entire circuits.
4	Abstract	1	3	As an entry to these circuits, we provide detailed anatomy of proboscis motor neurons, muscles, and joints.
5	Abstract	1	4	We create a collection of fly strains to individually manipulate every proboscis muscle through control of its motor neurons, the first such collection for an appendage.
6	Abstract	1	5	We generate a model of the action of each proboscis joint, and find that only a small number of motor neurons are needed to produce proboscis reaching.
7	Abstract	1	6	Comprehensive control of each motor element in this numerically simple system paves the way for future study of both reflexive and flexible movements of this appendage.
8	[Introduction]	1	1	Thank you for submitting your article "Comprehensive genetic tools to target motor neurons for each muscle of the fly proboscis" for consideration by eLife.
9	[Introduction]	1	2	Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ronald Calabrese as the Reviewing Editor, Senior Editor and Reviewer #2.
10	[Introduction]	2	1	The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.
11	[Introduction]	3	1	Summary:
12	[Introduction]	4	1	This is a co-submission of two papers.
13	[Introduction]	4	2	The goal of the first work is achieving genetic control over motor neurons for every muscle of the Drosophila proboscis, and it is accomplished convincingly.
14	[Introduction]	4	3	The degree of success constructing split Gal4 lines that label only a single bilateral pair of motor neuron corresponding to each muscle of the proboscis is really remarkable, and there is no doubt that these tools will be of tremendous use in defining the neuronal networks responsible for reaching movements of the proboscis and indeed the sucking movements also.
15	[Introduction]	4	4	The anatomical data presented is beautiful.
16	[Introduction]	4	5	After achieving genetic control over motor neurons for every muscle of the Drosophila proboscis, the authors in the second work systematically test every motor neuron that inserts on cuticle (including apodemes) and is thus likely to move the proboscis (rather than inserting on the pharynx and likely involved in sucking) with activation and inactivation experiments.
17	[Introduction]	4	6	By combining kinematics and some biomechanics, the authors arrive at a functional role for each of the proboscis inserting muscle and their motor neurons.
18	[Introduction]	4	7	The data presented is comprehensive and convincing.
19	[Introduction]	4	8	When combined these two papers, very clearly supersede a previous attempt (Schwarz et al., 2017) at such tool development and analysis with several important corrections and many major refinements.
20	[Introduction]	5	1	Essential revisions:
21	[Introduction]	6	1	Upon careful review of these two co-submitted papers (henceforth referred to a Paper 1 and Paper 2) it was the clear consensus of the reviewers that neither paper alone is strong enough for eLife and we would understand if you chose to take the paper(s) elsewhere.
22	[Introduction]	6	2	If on the other hand, you chose to submit the two papers to eLife as one joint paper, then we would ensure that they were sent to the same reviewers, and we think that there is a high chance of publication with a short turn-around.
23	[Introduction]	6	3	No new experiments or analyses are needed.
24	[Introduction]	7	1	If you take the eLife route the papers should be combined and focused.
25	[Introduction]	7	2	One paper will be easier for the authors to present and for the reader to comprehend.
26	[Introduction]	7	3	One could not read the Paper 2 without constantly referring to Paper 1 and the Paper 2 contains much repetition of the findings of Paper 1.
27	[Introduction]	8	1	There are several ways that the papers can be fitted together as detailed in the individual expert reviews.
28	[Introduction]	9	1	One potential path:
29	[Introduction]	10	1	1) The theme presented for Paper 1 of rhythmic vs. discrete behaviors is not effectively exploited nor can it be given the data presented.
30	[Introduction]	10	2	Likewise, the comparison to human reaching in Paper 2 seems premature and focusing the combined single paper on the tools developed and the wonderful anatomy and first-pass functional analysis seems more fruitful.
31	[Introduction]	10	3	The data Figure 9 Paper 1 seems premature and underdeveloped for publication as does the data of Figure 8 Paper 2.
32	[Introduction]	10	4	They are presented is support of the rhythmic vs. discrete behaviors and human reaching themes and are not compelling.
33	[Introduction]	10	5	We recommend removing these figures to focus the paper.
34	[Introduction]	11	1	2) Efficiency with the figures would help.
35	[Introduction]	11	2	Figure 1 of Paper 2 could benefit from comparison directly to Figure 1 of Paper 1.
36	[Introduction]	11	3	Figure 2 of Paper 1 should be supplementary and fits thematically with Paper 2 material.
37	[Introduction]	11	4	The expert reviews suggest other figure fusions and changes.
38	[Introduction]	12	1	3) The data of Figure 7 Paper 1 is reminiscent of data in Schwarz et al., 2017, albeit with corrections but need not be elaborated and could be perhaps combined with Figure 8 Paper 1, which is somewhat underdeveloped.
39	[Introduction]	13	1	4) Discussions can be shortened and in Paper 2 shifted away from detailed comparison to in Schwarz et al., 2017.
40	[Introduction]	14	1	5) All Essential revisions in the expert reviews should all be addressed.
41	[Introduction]	15	1	Reviewer #1:
42	[Introduction]	16	1	In two related papers, McKellar and colleagues present the results of a screen to genetically label and optogenetically activate each motor neuron that innervates muscles in the proboscis of Drosophila melanogaster.
43	[Introduction]	17	1	In the first manuscript, entitled "Comprehensive genetic tools to target motor neurons for each muscle of the fly proboscis", they present genetic driver lines for each motor neuron together with careful anatomy of cuticular structures and musculature.
44	[Introduction]	17	2	Ten proboscis muscles and their associated motor neurons control the position of proboscis parts and are involved in the proboscis extension response (PER), while the remaining eight muscles control the constriction of the pharynx.
45	[Introduction]	17	3	In the course of this work, the authors identify several new muscles.
46	[Introduction]	18	1	Once the authors develop split-Gal4 genetic labels for each motor neuron, they can drive the expression of CsChrimson to activate, or Tetanus toxin to silence, each motor neuron.
47	[Introduction]	18	2	They present the results of these experiments in a second paper entitled "Motor neuron control of Drosophila proboscis reaching".
48	[Introduction]	18	3	The main advances of this work are the resulting genetic tools and a more comprehensive knowledge of how particular muscles insert onto cuticular structures to extend or flex proboscis parts about joints.
49	[Introduction]	18	4	These advances clarify the results of past investigations similar into motor control of the proboscis (in particular, Schwarz, Motor control of Drosophila feeding behavior).
50	[Introduction]	19	1	Across both papers, the images of motor neuron and musculature anatomy are illustrative and quite beautiful.
51	[Introduction]	19	2	Optogenetic activation of individual motor neurons confirms the role each plays in controlling the proboscis segment.
52	[Introduction]	19	3	Together, these data allow the authors to articulate a model of how motor neuron activation and muscle contraction enables the fly to extend its proboscis.
53	[Introduction]	20	1	Although the tools and data in these papers are detailed and valuable, the papers do not effectively show what new insight has been gained relative to previous studies.
54	[Introduction]	20	2	There is also a large experimental gap: while the authors create the necessary genetic tools, they do not investigate the neural control and natural dynamics of proboscis movement beyond artificial optogenetic stimulation.
55	[Introduction]	20	3	In the absence of such data, the main contribution of these papers is the clear and thorough anatomy.
56	[Introduction]	20	4	However, the convoluted organization of the two manuscripts require the reader to sift through disparate data to reach a clear understanding of how the proboscis motor system is organized.
57	[Introduction]	20	5	These manuscripts would need to be significantly reorganized and streamlined to be understood by a general neuroscience audience.
58	[Introduction]	21	1	Essential revisions:
59	[Introduction]	22	1	1) It is not clear to why these manuscripts are separate.
60	[Introduction]	22	2	The basis for separating them seems to be to avoid one behemoth paper but the division between tools and function obscures the take-home message of the work.
61	[Introduction]	22	3	For example, many of the descriptions of musculature in "Comprehensive genetic tools to target motor neurons for each muscle of the fly proboscis" (called paper 1 below) are critical for understanding the optogenetic activation of motor neurons in "Motor neuron control of Drosophila proboscis reaching" (called paper 2 below), resulting in an unnecessary duplication of effort between the manuscripts to understand how the proboscis is moved.
62	[Introduction]	22	4	Take mn9, for example: it is hard to know what to take from Figure 1, Figure 4 and Figure 9 in paper 1, if the critical proof to show that mn9 extends the proboscis is in paper 2.
63	[Introduction]	22	5	(Past work has shown m9 to be involved in proboscis protraction, so you could argue that a knowledgeable reader may know this, but that undercuts the purpose of Figure 2 in paper 2).
64	[Introduction]	22	6	There are also examples of data in primary figures that do not advance the author's case.
65	[Introduction]	22	7	For example, in paper 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 6 and Figure 8 are supplementary figures.
66	[Introduction]	22	8	Figure 2: The images of FlyLight Gen 1 Gal4 lines are unhelpful, fly researchers can find these and they are not helpful to a non-Drosophilist.
67	[Introduction]	22	9	Figure 3: I commend the authors for including images of the entire nervous system, not often shown, but again, these are supporting information.
68	[Introduction]	22	10	Figure 6 can support Figure 5.
69	[Introduction]	22	11	Figure 8 does suggest that MNs likely do not receive direct information from sensory neurons or other previously described interneurons, but these hypotheses are not tested further, so Figure 8 can support Figure 7.
70	[Introduction]	23	1	By the same token, paper 2 would benefit from schematics of muscles and an overview of reaching related vs. pharyngeal motor neurons.
71	[Introduction]	23	2	This distinction is helpful, and since it is consistent with past work.
72	[Introduction]	23	3	Because the function of pharyngeal muscles is not explored further, it would not detract from the message of paper 2. paper 2 contains functional data that can be combined: e.g. protraction (Figure 2) and retraction (Figure 3) of the rostrum could be one figure, together with anatomical data from paper 1.
73	[Introduction]	23	4	Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 also contain many panels of different metrics, normalized or baseline subtracted.
74	[Introduction]	23	5	It is not necessary to show all these data in this form, and it detracts from the message.
75	[Introduction]	23	6	My suggestion would be to combine Figure 2 Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 haustellum and rostrum images.
76	[Introduction]	23	7	Figure 7 is beautiful!
77	[Introduction]	23	8	But it should be split up to accompany the data in Figure 2 and Figure 3 and Figure 4 and Figure 5.
78	[Introduction]	24	1	In addition, much of the introductions of both manuscripts are either unnecessary or misleading (see below), so combining the data into a single manuscript will also help to eliminate those problems.
79	[Introduction]	24	2	In summary, I do not see a clear reason to split data across papers.
80	[Introduction]	25	1	2) The optogenetic activation data that the authors present do not provide insight into how reaching kinematics are produced: 2 second stimulation of motor neurons is not a naturalistic manipulation, and resulting proboscis trajectories are collapsed into single numbers in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6 of paper 2.
81	[Introduction]	25	2	Schwarz et al., also concluded that reaching is the result of precise temporal patterns of activation of proboscis motor neurons.
82	[Introduction]	25	3	The authors have all the tools to explore this further with calcium imaging or electrophysiology, though it is understandably beyond the scope of this paper.
83	[Introduction]	25	4	I anticipate another paper that begins with the observations in Figure 8 of paper 2 and then uses the tools shown here to explore how these searching movements are created.
84	[Introduction]	26	1	3) A related aspect of reaching is the treatment of what the authors call "coupling" of distinct parts of the proboscis, as when mn9 is activated and extends the haustellum in addition to the rostrum.
85	[Introduction]	26	2	Is this coupling mechanical, neural, or driven by proprioceptive feedback?
86	[Introduction]	26	3	The activation of additional motor neurons could be ruled out by silencing haustellum extending mns while activating mn9.
87	[Introduction]	26	4	The authors do not discuss sensory feedback, or the role of proprioception in determining the location of the target.
88	[Introduction]	26	5	This would be an interesting direction to pursue to draw closer connections to reaching in other organisms.
89	[Introduction]	27	1	4) The authors state at various times that these genetic tools could help to make neural control of the proboscis a model for (1) rhythmic vs. discrete movements, and (2) a model of reaching in humans.
90	[Introduction]	27	2	These statements appear in the abstract and introductions of both papers, with little scholarship or links to literature that may prime the reader as to functional features that are similar in both models.
91	[Introduction]	27	3	The data to support these assertions are that proboscis speed is a bell shaped curve as a function of time and that proboscis reaching pauses to enter a second phase of slow approach.
92	[Introduction]	27	4	These observations seem rather trivial; what is the alternative?
93	[Introduction]	27	5	As the authors point out, proboscis reaching is already thought to be more complex than simply a reflex.
94	[Introduction]	28	1	Reviewer #2:
95	[Introduction]	29	1	Achieving genetic control over motor neurons for every muscle of the Drosophila proboscis is the laudable goal of this work, and it is accomplished convincingly.
96	[Introduction]	29	2	Surely there are nits to pick over the failure the achieve split Gal4 lines that label only a single bilateral pair of motor neuron corresponding to each muscle of the proboscis, BUT the degree of success is really remarkable, and there is no doubt that these tools will be of tremendous use in defining the neuronal networks responsible for reaching movements of the proboscis and indeed the sucking movements also.
97	[Introduction]	29	3	The anatomical data presented is beautiful.
98	[Introduction]	29	4	When combined with the companion paper (Motor neuron control of Drosophila proboscis reaching) it is very clear that this work supersedes a previous attempt (Schwarz et al., 2017) at such tool development and analysis with several important corrections and many major refinements
99	[Introduction]	30	1	Essential revisions:
100	[Introduction]	31	1	Upon carefully reviewing this paper (henceforth referred to a Paper 1) and its companion by the exact same authors (Motor neuron control of Drosophila proboscis reaching - henceforth referred to as Paper 2), I do not recommend that they be published independently.
101	[Introduction]	31	2	One paper will be easier for the authors to present and for the reader to comprehend.
102	[Introduction]	31	3	I could not read the Paper 2 without constantly referring to Paper 1 and the Paper 2 contains much repetition of the findings of Paper 1.
103	[Introduction]	31	4	The theme presented for Paper 1 of rhythmic vs. discrete behaviors is not effectively exploited nor can it be given the data presented so much of the rationale for an independent paper is lost.
104	[Introduction]	31	5	There are several ways that the papers can be fitted together.
105	[Introduction]	31	6	Efficiency with the figures would help.
106	[Introduction]	31	7	Figure 1 of Paper 2 could benefit from comparison directly to Figure 1 of Paper 1.
107	[Introduction]	31	8	Figure 2 of Paper 1 should be supplementary and fits thematically with Paper 2.
108	[Introduction]	31	9	The VNC confocal projection of Figure 3 Paper 1 are distracting, convey little information useful to the general reader, and can certainly be supplementary.
109	[Introduction]	31	10	The data of Figure 7 Paper 1 is reminiscent of data in Schwarz et al., 2017, albeit with corrections but need not be elaborated and could be perhaps combined with Figure 8 Paper 1 which is somewhat underdeveloped.
110	[Introduction]	31	11	The data Figure 9 Paper 1 seems premature for publication.
111	[Introduction]	32	1	Reviewer #3:
112	[Introduction]	33	1	This work provides tools that target every type of motor neurons in the proboscis, as evidenced by the fact that all muscle types are covered by the domains of neuromuscular junctions.
113	[Introduction]	33	2	Proximity of motor neuron dendrites to other neurons provide hints as to the interaction of sensory and central circuits with the motor neurons.
114	[Introduction]	33	3	These tools can now be used for functional studies, an example of which is provided in the accompanying manuscript.
115	[Introduction]	33	4	I found this to be really nice manuscript that will certainly be very useful for the Drosophila neural circuit community, particularly those working on feeding behavior.
116	[Introduction]	33	5	It really fills a missing dataset, complementing the numerous sensory neuron lines that are available, as well as the increasing number of interneuronal lines that have been used for feeding behavior analysis.
117	[Introduction]	33	6	My comments are not of the major kind, focusing more on presentation style.
118	[Introduction]	34	1	[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]
119	[Introduction]	35	1	Thank you for resubmitting your article "Controlling every muscle for directed reaching of the fly proboscis" for consideration by eLife.
120	[Introduction]	35	2	Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ronald Calabrese as the Reviewing Editor, Senior Editor and Reviewer #2.
121	[Introduction]	36	1	The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.
122	[Introduction]	37	1	We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162).
123	[Introduction]	37	2	Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as eLife papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger.
124	[Introduction]	37	3	Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.
125	[Introduction]	38	1	Summary:
126	[Introduction]	39	1	This paper presents remarkable anatomy and structure-function analysis of the muscles controlling the proboscis of Drosophila and firmly establishing this as model for the study of directed movements.
127	[Introduction]	39	2	They also perform thorough motor neuron activation (CsChrimson) /silencing (TNT) experiments using highly specific splitGAL4 lines and the lines provide a great set of tools for deeper functional analysis going forward.
128	[Introduction]	40	1	Title: Please consider the changes to the title suggested by reviewer #1.
129	[Introduction]	41	1	Essential revisions:
130	[Introduction]	42	1	The authors have made a very strong revision of the manuscript, responding appropriately to all the reviewer comments.
131	[Introduction]	42	2	In the spirit of make a strong paper even stronger, the reviewers present further revisions, that can be accomplished expeditiously and can be reviewed by the RE.
132	[Introduction]	43	1	Reviewer #1:
133	[Introduction]	44	1	Summary:
134	[Introduction]	45	1	This revised manuscript, in which the authors combined their two previous manuscripts, is much improved.
135	[Introduction]	45	2	I have one point that should be addressed to help improve the clarity and organization of the paper.
136	[Introduction]	46	1	Essential revisions:
137	[Introduction]	47	1	Figure 7 and Figure 8 contain many separate panels that describe the effects of activation and deficits of silencing proboscis motor neurons.
138	[Introduction]	47	2	Even though the y-axis labels contain the information they report, each panel uses different units, which makes it confusing for readers to understand how these values relate to proboscis kinematics.
139	[Introduction]	48	1	In particular, interpreting changes in angle during feeding requires extra mental gymnastics.
140	[Introduction]	48	2	The change in angle from rest to feeding appears to be 80 deg (Figure 7I and Figure 7J).
141	[Introduction]	48	3	Activating mn9 does not further increase the rostrum feeding angle in Figure 7D.
142	[Introduction]	48	4	One might then attempt to compare angles in Figure 7I and Figure 7D, but the authors are thinking about this differently.
143	[Introduction]	48	5	Their logic is that activation (Figure7D) happens after the proboscis is extended, so the change should be about 0, whereas the positive 80 deg change during feeding does not occur when mn9 is silenced.
144	[Introduction]	49	1	I suggest that instead of displaying the change in rostrum and haustellum angle during feeding, the authors should plot rostrum and haustellum angle during feeding.
145	[Introduction]	49	2	The authors should also explain the rationale behind the units in the legend.
146	[Introduction]	49	3	It is possible that chrimson expression in mn9 actually causes a different feeding angle to begin with, which would be interesting.
147	[Introduction]	49	4	If the proboscis was more extended, this would suggest an increase in baseline excitation.
148	[Introduction]	49	5	If it was more flexed and retracted, it could imply compensatory feedback to combat overexcitation.
149	[Introduction]	49	6	Same for mns 1 and 2V.
150	[Introduction]	50	1	Reviewer #3:
151	[Introduction]	51	1	What a gorgeous paper.
152	[Introduction]	51	2	I think it's a wonderful piece of work.
153	[Introduction]	51	3	I only have two very minor comments on the revision:
154	[Introduction]	52	1	1) Subsection “An updated inventory of proboscis muscles” (second paragraph).
155	[Introduction]	52	2	Either a semi-colon or full stop after m3M.
156	[Introduction]	52	3	Also, in the figure legend, define L at the bottom.
157	[Introduction]	53	1	2) In the Abstract, they write "…and throughout entire circuits, as the fly connectome approaches."
158	[Introduction]	53	2	However, there is no mention of this theme in the Discussion section.
159	[Introduction]	53	3	Maybe a sentence or two somewhere in the Discussion section on how their identification of the muscles and the motor neurons might help decipher the meaning of the interneuronal connections that will be revealed in the connectome.
160	[Introduction]	53	4	I personally believe it will be enormously useful, because, as the authors write (Introduction), "…they are the outputs upon which higher order circuits must act."
161	[Introduction]	54	1	Now removed.
162	[Introduction]	55	1	We understand the reservations about the analogy to directed reaching in vertebrates, and have removed the more speculative mention of this idea.
163	[Introduction]	55	2	However, since we do believe this to be an exciting future application of this work, we include it briefly in the Discussion section.
164	[Introduction]	56	1	Done.
165	[Introduction]	57	1	Now reorganised.
166	[Introduction]	58	1	now removed for the sake of streamlining, since it made only a minor point.
167	[Introduction]	59	1	Done.
168	[Introduction]	60	1	We have handled this according to Reviewer 1’s request that the former Figure 8 be a supplement to the former Figure 7 - now Figure 5.
169	[Introduction]	61	1	We have removed the detailed comparison from the text.
170	[Introduction]	61	2	There are differences in the findings that significantly alter interpretation of muscle roles, so wenow provide a supplementary table (newFigure 9 -figure supplement 1) summarizing our findings, and showing with asterisks which are new or different from published work.]
171	[Introduction]	62	1	Done.
172	[Introduction]	63	1	Please see newFigure 9 -figure supplement 1 summarizing that 12 of the 16 behavioral phenotypes we describe were previously unknown.
173	[Introduction]	64	1	While optogenetic activation is artificial, silencing experiments are carried out in flies performing natural behaviors (for example, in Figure 8F-J and Figure 9H-I).
174	[Introduction]	64	2	Controls in these experiments provide measures of natural behavior.
175	[Introduction]	64	3	Besides these experiments, natural behavior was also tested in wildtype flies using five other measures (Figure 2E-G, K-L), plus an additional four now removed by reviewer request (previous paper 2, Figure 8).
176	[Introduction]	64	4	Certainly, more characterization of natural behavior will be needed in the future to describe precise kinematics.
177	[Introduction]	65	1	Now combined into one paper.
178	[Introduction]	66	1	Now reorganized.
179	[Introduction]	67	1	now removed.
180	[Introduction]	68	1	Done.
181	[Introduction]	69	1	We have made room in other ways so that this can remain a main figure, since it is a key theme of the paper that insertion sites predict muscle function.
182	[Introduction]	70	1	Done.
183	[Introduction]	71	1	now combined
184	[Introduction]	72	1	Done.
185	[Introduction]	73	1	Each panel shows a different behavior without redundancy; all are necessary for a full description of each motor neuron’s phenotype.
186	[Introduction]	73	2	We now streamline by showing extensors and retractors in the same plots.
187	[Introduction]	74	1	Previous 2-4 and 2-5 now combined.
188	[Introduction]	75	1	Great suggestion - done.
189	[Introduction]	76	1	Due to another request, we have removed the former Paper 2, Figure 8, but this had shown an un-collapsed quantification of how proboscis speed, velocity, length and distance varied over time.
190	[Introduction]	77	1	We agree.
191	[Introduction]	78	1	We agree with this assessment as a future direction, and mention this need in the Discussion.
192	[Introduction]	79	1	Figure now removed, as per editor’s suggestion, and topics now moved to Discussion as future areas of research.
193	[Introduction]	80	1	Theme now removed.
194	[Introduction]	81	1	Now reorganised.
195	[Introduction]	82	1	Done.
196	[Introduction]	83	1	We have handled this according to Reviewer 1’s request that the former Figure 8 be a supplement to the former 7, now Figure 5.
197	[Introduction]	84	1	Now removed.[
198	[Introduction]	84	2	Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]
199	[Introduction]	85	1	The units for Figure 7 are briefly explained in the legend, which also now directs readers to more information in the Materials and methods section.
200	[Introduction]	86	1	Figure 7 shows how motor neuron activations change proboscis angle.
201	[Introduction]	86	2	We chose normalized angles because the way we mount flies results in different starting positions, which makes raw (absolute) angles more variable.
202	[Introduction]	86	3	We expand the explanation for using normalization in Materials and methods section, and direct the reader there from both the text and the legend of Figure 7.
203	[Introduction]	86	4	We also include a new Figure 7 - supplement with an analysis of the raw angles, as the reviewer requested.
204	[Introduction]	87	1	The expanded explanation reads, “Measures of joint angles were chosen to best suit each assay.
205	[Introduction]	87	2	Due to the challenge of gluing flies to pins manually, the camera view varied, leading to variability in the measured raw angles of the joints.
206	[Introduction]	87	3	To overcome this variability, within-fly normalization was performed wherever possible, subtracting food- or CsChrimson-stimulated extension angle from the angle immediately before stimulation.
207	[Introduction]	87	4	Note that normalization was not possible for resting state angles, since there is no change from baseline.
208	[Introduction]	87	5	Analysis of raw joint angles (Figure 7-figure supplement 2) shows similar relations between motor neurons and joint angles as the normalized data but with greater inter-fly variability, as expected from the range of starting positions, so the main figures use normalized values as follows…”

218	[Introduction]	97	1	Now a brief mention in the Discussion section.
219	Introduction	1	1	To interact with the world, many organisms rely on an ability to reach an appendage towards a target, yet much remains to be discovered about how neural circuits control this prototypical goal-directed behavior.
220	Introduction	1	2	Here we investigate the fly proboscis (mouthparts), a segmented appendage homologous to a limb (Bridges and Dobzhansky, 1933).
221	Introduction	1	3	The proboscis is capable of directed reaching towards a specifically placed food target, using gustatory information from taste receptors on the legs as they move and contact food (Dethier, 1976).
222	Introduction	1	4	Besides feeding, the proboscis also extends during courtship (Sturtevant, 1915), grooming (Szebenyi, 1969), flight-associated respiration (Lehmann and Heymann, 2005), and wing expansion after eclosion (Baker and Truman, 2002), suggesting that it is a multifunctional appendage that can be employed flexibly.
223	Introduction	2	1	A good starting point for mapping circuits underlying motor control is to identify motor neurons, since they are the outputs upon which higher order circuits must act.
224	Introduction	2	2	In adult flies, most muscles are innervated by only one or a few motor neurons (see, for example, Baek and Mann, 2009; O'Sullivan et al., 2018; Rajashekhar and Singh, 1994; Trimarchi and Schneiderman, 1994).
225	Introduction	2	3	Identifying many or all of the motor neurons involved in proboscis extension should be feasible with available genetic tools.
226	Introduction	2	4	Groups of neurons can be activated and silenced to determine their behavioral phenotypes using collections of GAL4 lines (Brand and Perrimon, 1993), which reproducibly target different groups of neurons.
227	Introduction	2	5	Previous efforts using GAL4 lines with broader expression patterns, or stochastic techniques to refine GAL4 lines, identified some of the critical motor neurons (Gordon and Scott, 2009; Schwarz et al., 2017).
228	Introduction	2	6	Here we use the split GAL4 technique, which intersects two expression patterns to genetically target only the cells in common between the two (Luan et al., 2006), to provide more precise and reproducible targeting of particular neurons.
229	Introduction	2	7	We create a collection of split GAL4 fly strains to identify and separately target the primary motor neurons for every proboscis muscle.
230	Introduction	3	1	To support this collection of genetic reagents, we provide detailed anatomy of the proboscis from a variety of imaging techniques.
231	Introduction	3	2	We show each proboscis muscle in new detail, propose a systematic nomenclature to resolve earlier discrepancies, and use muscle insertion sites to predict function.
232	Introduction	3	3	We predict that 8 of the 16 proboscis muscles should be involved in proboscis positioning (such as reaching), and the other half should be involved in the proboscis’ other main function, pumping food through the pharynx (investigated by others; Flood et al., 2013; Manzo et al., 2012; Tissot et al., 1998).
233	Introduction	3	4	Here we focus on the predicted positioning muscles and define their roles by genetic activation and silencing of their motor neurons.
234	Introduction	3	5	Altogether, we achieve genetic control over every muscle involved in this form of directed reaching, and provide detailed anatomy of this appendage.
235	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	1	1	Our first goal was to use updated imaging techniques to display the overall anatomy of the proboscis (Figure 1).
236	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	2	1	Work that predated confocal microscopy (Miller, 1950) showed that the proboscis is extended during feeding.
237	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	2	2	Food is sucked in through the lip-like labella at the tip, then pumped through the pharynx, traveling through two segments of the proboscis, first the haustellum then the rostrum.
238	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	2	3	Inside the head, food then enters the esophagus, which passes through a foramen in the brain, and carries food towards the gut.
239	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	2	4	Figure 1A shows these structures by confocal imaging of thick sections of fly heads with the proboscis in different degrees of extension.
240	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	3	1	In the retracted state, the rostrum rests near the brain inside the head, and the haustellum is folded up against the rostrum (Figure 1A).
241	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	3	2	When the rostrum extends, it is protracted ventrally out of the head capsule.
242	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	3	3	The outer cuticle of the rostrum is largely unsclerotized, giving it flexibility to fold like skin; support for several muscles therefore comes from an internal skeleton of rigid cuticular structures (Figure 1A-C).
243	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	3	4	The haustellum extends and flexes from its joint with the rostrum.
244	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	3	5	These movements were confirmed in live flies by filming proboscis extension in a synchrotron particle accelerator, using x-rays to render flies partly transparent and show the movement of the segments inside the head capsule (Video 1).
245	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	4	1	To locate proboscis joints with standard light cameras, proboscis extension was triggered in tethered flies by stimulating leg gustatory receptors with a droplet of sucrose (approximate joint locations marked, Video 2).
246	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	4	2	Gluing the head and one proboscis joint shows only the movement of the remaining joint: the rostrum pivots around a point on the anterior head that we designate the rostrum joint (Video 3, and also visible in Video 1), and the haustellum pivots around a point near the rostrum-haustellum junction (Video 4).
247	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	4	3	We digested soft tissues from the thick slices of fly heads, leaving the rigid external and internal cuticle to visualize the locations of the articulation points (Figure 1B,C).
248	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	4	4	Without implying genetic homology, a useful analogy is that the rostrum and haustellum move somewhat like the human upper arm and lower arm, the first segment swinging away from the body and the second unfolding from the first.
249	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	4	5	(The movements of the rostrum are called protraction vs. retraction, whereas the movements of the haustellum are extension vs. flexion [Miller, 1950]).
250	Results; Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints	4	6	For this study, we focused on movements in only two dimensions, in the vertical plane - reaching up and down with respect to the body axis.
251	Results; A quantitative description of proboscis reaching	1	1	Armed with this demonstration of how the segments of the proboscis subserve proboscis extension, we sought quantitative proof that the Drosophila proboscis is capable of directed reaching.
252	Results; A quantitative description of proboscis reaching	1	2	We had observed that, for a freely moving fly to feed, the proboscis must extend ventrally if the food is on the surface on which the fly is standing (Figure 2A, Video 5).
253	Results; A quantitative description of proboscis reaching	1	3	In contrast, we find that a male courting a female on a flat surface typically extends his proboscis anteriorly towards the female for courtship licking (Figure 2B, Video 6).
254	Results; A quantitative description of proboscis reaching	1	4	To quantify reaching in these particular situations, the angles of the head (Figure 2C), rostrum (Figure 2C), and haustellum (Figure 2D) were measured.
255	Results; A quantitative description of proboscis reaching	1	5	Both the head and the rostrum were angled higher (more anteriorly) in the courtship experiments than in feeding, on average (Figure 2E-F).
256	Results; A quantitative description of proboscis reaching	1	6	The haustellum was more extended for ventral feeding, and more flexed for anterior courtship licking (Figure 2G).
257	Results; A quantitative description of proboscis reaching	1	7	The proboscis is thus capable of reaching to ethologically relevant targets in different locations, making use of the head, the rostrum and the haustellum.
258	Results; A quantitative description of proboscis reaching	2	1	This differential reaching may not be inherently due to feeding or courtship, but to the location of the targets; perhaps the food was just located more ventrally than the female, prompting more ventral proboscis extension.
259	Results; A quantitative description of proboscis reaching	2	2	We thus quantified proboscis reaching to food targets placed in different locations with respect to the head of a tethered fly.
260	Results; A quantitative description of proboscis reaching	2	3	When the sucrose was placed low or high (more ventral or more anterior, Figure 2H-J), the proboscis was indeed capable of low vs. high reaching (Figure 2K, Video 7), with decent aim (Figure 2L).
261	Results; A quantitative description of proboscis reaching	2	4	Although individual flies could angle joints differentially to different targets (gray lines, Figure 2M-O), only the haustellum showed a mean difference across target positions (black bars, Figure 2M-O), suggesting that the haustellum can be independently controlled to aid reaching.
262	Results; A quantitative description of proboscis reaching	2	5	Each of the three body parts (rostrum, haustellum and head) is capable of at least some degree of independent movement, since if two of the three parts were glued, the remaining part could still move (Videos 3, 4 and 8).
263	Results; A quantitative description of proboscis reaching	2	6	Reaching was guided not by a visual target (due to filming under invisible infrared light) but by contact between the waving legs and the sucrose target; the relevant sensory stimuli are therefore: 1) taste, and 2) proprioception about leg position at the time of sucrose contact.
264	Results; An updated inventory of proboscis muscles	1	1	To explore how anatomy supports this reaching, we adapted a clearing technique (Ott, 2008) to stain and image whole-mount heads, and reveal intact muscles and their motor neurons with high clarity (Video 9).
265	Results; An updated inventory of proboscis muscles	1	2	Using 3D segmentation, we traced every muscle in the proboscis of the mature adult (Figure 3A, Video 10).
266	Results; An updated inventory of proboscis muscles	1	3	We find a total count of 16 proboscis muscles.
267	Results; An updated inventory of proboscis muscles	1	4	(Other muscles are present at eclosion, possibly to help the fly push out of the puparium, but subsequently degenerate, Miller, 1950).
268	Results; An updated inventory of proboscis muscles	2	1	Different names are given to identical muscles in recent papers (Flood et al., 2013; Schwarz et al., 2017), therefore we propose a nomenclature with new suffixes to resolve confusion, consisting of informative letters instead of numbers (Figure 3B, Table 1).
269	Results; An updated inventory of proboscis muscles	2	2	For example, the former 2-1 and 2-2 are now 2D and 2V, referring to more dorsal or ventral insertion sites.
270	Results; An updated inventory of proboscis muscles	2	3	A prefix of ‘m’ refers to muscle, ‘mn’ refers to motor neuron(s) for that muscle.
271	Results; An updated inventory of proboscis muscles	2	4	(We show below separable neuronal control of the newly found m3L and its neighbor m3M; however their adjacent insertions and origins lead us to define these as separate groups of fibers in a single muscle, m3.
272	Results; An updated inventory of proboscis muscles	2	5	Aside from this exception, suffixes denote separate muscles).
273	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	1	1	To understand the neural control of these muscles, we created genetic reagents to target every primary proboscis motor neuron type.
274	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	1	2	By inspecting thousands of Rubin and VT-GAL4 lines (Jenett et al., 2012; Pfeiffer et al., 2010; Tirian and Dickson, 2017), we selected 100 lines with neurons resembling candidate proboscis motor neurons (characterized by large somata in the SEZ and axons in the SEZ nerves), to stain with the new head clearing technique.
275	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	1	3	Of these, 77 indeed had motor neurons projecting to proboscis muscles (Table 2; see example in Video 9).
276	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	1	4	Few contained only a single motor neuron type, and all contained many other cells in the brain.
277	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	2	1	To obtain more specific expression patterns, we intersected these lines using the split GAL4 genetic technique (Luan et al., 2006).
278	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	2	2	A many-to-many approach was taken, staining several combinations of lines that each contained a motor neuron of interest (along with other cells).
279	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	2	3	A final collection of 17 split GAL4 lines was selected, most of which target a single motor neuron type (with exceptions being one line targeting both mn11V and 12D, and three lines for mn3) (Table 1).
280	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	2	4	Proboscis staining showed each line’s muscle targets (Figure 4), with good reproducibility of expression patterns across specimens (Table 1).
281	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	2	5	Central nervous system (CNS) staining showed that besides expression in proboscis motor neurons, these 17 were otherwise quite sparse (Figure 4-figure supplement 1), having been selected from a total of 389 combinations by CNS staining.
282	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	3	1	Our goal in building this collection of lines was to target every primary excitatory motor neuron type of the proboscis.
283	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	3	2	In the larva, the primary excitatory motor neurons are called Type Ib and Is; the motor neurons here most closely resemble the majority of larval Type Ib neurons in that they innervate only a single muscle, unlike the more promiscuous larval type Is (Budnik and Ruiz-Canada, 2006).
284	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	3	3	(We did not seek modulatory motor neurons, analogous to type II and III in larva, which are characterized by small boutons on thin axons projecting to multiple muscles [Prokop, 2006], and are known to exist in the adult proboscis [Pauls et al., 2018].)
285	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	3	4	To determine whether this collection was complete, we stained each line with nc82, considered a pan-synaptic marker (Wagh et al., 2006).
286	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	3	5	All the boutons on the relevant muscle were indeed completely occupied by the labeled motor neurons (examples in Figure 4-figure supplement 2, N in Table 1), with two exceptions: muscle 3 is covered by separate lines (mn3M and mn3L) so was not expected to show complete occupancy, and mn10 was never labeled bilaterally in the split GAL4 line we selected (see Methods).
287	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	3	6	All other synaptic sites were occupied, and since the synaptic marker does label primary motor neuron synapses, we conclude that this collection includes every primary motor neuron.
288	Results; Achieving genetic control of proboscis motor neurons	3	7	The coverage of all a muscle’s synaptic sites by only one or a few motor neurons per hemisphere shows that single motor neurons must branch to many or all of the separate fibers that make up a muscle (Figure 4-figure supplements 1 and 2).
289	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	1	1	While the axons of motor neurons innervate muscles, their dendrites are located in the subesophageal zone of the brain.
290	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	1	2	The organization of these dendrites was examined by segmenting them from split GAL4 images (or from stochastic labeling of split GAL4s, in cases where neighboring cells in the brain made identities uncertain), to give a clear view of every defined motor neuron type (Figure 5, Video 11).
291	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	2	1	Each line has only one or a few bilateral motor neuron pairs (Figure 5) to cover its muscle.
292	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	2	2	All dendritic arbors except salivary mn13 fall into one of two regions, dorsal or ventral, which partially overlap (Figure 5B).
293	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	2	3	These divisions did not correlate with muscles found in the rostrum vs. haustellum (Table 1).
294	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	2	4	Instead, with few exceptions, the dorsal region was occupied by motor neurons with pharyngeal insertion sites, whereas the ventral region was generally occupied by non-pharyngeal motor neurons (Table 1).
295	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	2	5	Pharyngeal and non-pharyngeal motor neurons also tended to have dorsal and ventral somas, respectively, and axons leaving the brain through dorsal and ventral proboscis nerves (‘pharyngeal’ and ‘compound labial’ nerves, respectively, Hartenstein et al., 2018), with certain exceptions (Figure 5B, Table 1).
296	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	3	1	The segmented motor neuron dendrites permit computational registration with images of other feeding-related neuron classes, to determine proximity between them (although not synaptic connectivity).
297	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	3	2	Sweet inputs avoid the ventral arbors of the rostrum protractor’s mn9, passing through two circular gaps to terminate more dorsally (Figure 5-figure supplement 1A,B), consistent with their known lack of contact with mn9 (Gordon and Scott, 2009).
298	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	3	3	Sweet inputs likewise pass through gaps in the arbor of mn1 (Figure 5-figure supplement 1C,D), and also do not overlap with a pharyngeal neuron mn11D (Figure 5-figure supplement 1E,F).
299	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	3	4	They do lie somewhat near the salivary mn13 (Figure 5-figure supplement 1G,H).
300	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	4	1	The circular gap in motor neuron arbors is particularly evident when several motor neurons (mn1, 9, 11D and 13) are overlaid (Figure 5-figure supplement 1I).
301	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	4	2	We have previously shown that eye mechanosensory bristle neurons project to the ventral SEZ (Hampel et al., 2017), and now find that the glomerular-like terminals of these mechanosensory inputs occupy the circular gaps in motor neuron arbors (Figure 5-figure supplement 1J).
302	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	4	3	Proboscis mechanosensory neurons also terminate in the same region (Zhou et al., 2019).
303	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	4	4	Motor neurons are thus mainly excluded from the base of the compound labial nerve where certain mechanosensory and taste inputs enter the SEZ.
304	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	5	1	Although bitter taste can cause proboscis retraction (Dethier, 1976), we find that bitter inputs do not directly overlap the retractor motor neurons (one example: Figure 5-figure supplement 1K).
305	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	5	2	The main retractor motor neuron, mn1, is near peptidergic Hugin neurons, thought to inhibit feeding initiation (Melcher and Pankratz, 2005; Figure 5-figure supplement 1L,M).
306	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	5	3	Hugin neurons do not lie close to 9 or 11D (not shown), but do show proximity to the salivary mn13 (Figure 5-figure supplement 1N).
307	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	6	1	Fdg, a pair of command-like neurons that can activate several features of the feeding motor program (Flood et al., 2013), was segmented here from a broader GAL4 line.
308	Results; Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain	6	2	After computationally aligning images to a common template, Fdg shows little or no overlap with a retractor, protractor, or pharyngeal motor neuron (Video 12), suggesting that there are additional interneuron layers yet to be found.
309	Results; Muscles that control the pharynx	1	1	Although interneuronal circuits for proboscis motor control will be of future interest, here we aimed to establish the general functions of proboscis muscles.
310	Results; Muscles that control the pharynx	1	2	Predictions about function can be made by understanding the insertion sites of muscles.
311	Results; Muscles that control the pharynx	1	3	We stained cuticle, tendons and muscle to reveal every muscle insertion site (Figure 6 and Figure 6-figure supplement 1).
312	Results; Muscles that control the pharynx	1	4	Previously, three muscles were thought to control the pumping of food through the pharynx Flood et al., 2013; Manzo et al., 2012; Tissot et al., 1998; our staining now reveals a total of eight muscles associated with the pharynx.
313	Results; Muscles that control the pharynx	1	5	One (m13) inserts at the junction between the salivary duct and the pharynx (Figure 6A) and is predicted to open a valve for salivation.
314	Results; Muscles that control the pharynx	1	6	The seven others insert on the pharynx wall (Figure 6A), either directly or through tendons (Figure 6-figure supplement 2A,B).
315	Results; Muscles that control the pharynx	1	7	During feeding, furrows (pseudotrachea) on the labella may channel fluid to the opening of the pharynx (Figure 6-figure supplement 2C).
316	Results; Muscles that control the pharynx	1	8	Because the seven muscles attached to the pharynx are arrayed along the pharynx in series, we predict that sequential contraction would cause a traveling local dilation of the pharynx wall to move a bolus of fluid through the proboscis (Video 13), acting against the elasticity of the pharynx wall rather than antagonistic muscle counterparts.
317	Results; Muscles that control the pharynx	1	9	After food has been pumped through the pharynx to the esophagus, a ring of muscles surrounding the esophagus suggests that peristaltic action takes over (Figure 6-figure supplement 2D).
318	Results; Muscles that control the pharynx	1	10	This model, based on our analysis of insertion sites, provides testable predictions for future experiments.
319	Results; Muscles that control the pharynx	2	1	Eight other muscles were of more interest to us as they do not insert on the pharynx (Figure 6B and Figure 6-figure supplement 1), and are therefore candidates for proboscis positioning.
320	Results; Muscles that control the pharynx	2	2	Having genetic access to each motor neuron type, we manipulated each of the eight putative positioning motor neuron types to identify the muscles controlling reaching.
321	Results; Muscles that control the pharynx	2	3	We used a comprehensive battery of tests involving genetic activation and silencing, from the resting proboscis position and also during feeding from an extended position, measuring the position of the proboscis and the angle of each joint.
322	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	1	1	Examining the joints in order of proximal to distal, we first examined the control of the rostrum.
323	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	1	2	Muscle 9 had previously been shown to be involved in rostrum protraction by stochastically targeting its motor neuron from a more complicated expression pattern (Gordon and Scott, 2009).
324	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	1	3	Now with reproducible genetic access to the bilateral pair of mn9, we activated it with CsChrimson (Klapoetke et al., 2014) and confirmed that it elicited proboscis extension (Figure 7A,K,L, Figure 7-figure supplement 1).
325	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	1	4	(Joint angle measurements are reported as change in angle from baseline wherever possible, as explained in the Materials and methods, but are also available as raw angles in Figure 7-figure supplement 2).
326	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	1	5	We saw not only protraction of the rostrum but also extension of the haustellum (Figure 7B-C, Video 14).
327	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	1	6	Activation during feeding, when the proboscis is already extended, did not elicit any further extension (Figure 7D-E).
328	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	1	7	Silencing mn9 with tetanus toxin (Sweeney et al., 1995) did not impair proboscis position or joint angles at rest (Figure 7F-H), but prevented the movement of both the rostrum and haustellum during natural feeding (Figure 7I-J, Video 14), leaving only the movement of the labella (Figure 9H, Video 14). mn9 thus shows both activation and silencing phenotypes at the rostrum joint, where its muscle is physically located, but also at the more distant haustellum joint.
329	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	1	8	This demonstrates an example of coupling, where one joint’s action affects others, often for biomechanical reasons (Lang and Schieber, 2004).
330	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	1	9	In sum, muscle 9 is a protractor of the rostrum, but with wider effects.
331	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	2	1	What muscles might counteract the protractor action of muscle 9, leading to rostrum retraction?
332	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	2	2	Three muscles (1, 2D, 2V) could act as rostrum retractors based on their origins on the posterior wall of the head, and insertions near the distal end of the rostrum where they could potentially withdraw the rostrum into the head capsule (Figure 7M-O).
333	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	2	3	Activation of the motor neurons for the largest of these, muscle 1, indeed retracted the proboscis into the head further than where it sits at rest (Figure 7A), by retraction of the rostrum (Figure 7B) but not the haustellum (Figure 7C).
334	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	2	4	Activating mn1 while the proboscis was extended for feeding triggered both retraction of the rostrum and flexion of the haustellum (Figure 7D-E, Figure 7-figure supplement 1C-D, Video 15).
335	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	2	5	Whereas activation triggered retraction, silencing mn1 showed the opposite phenotype, impairing the retraction of the proboscis at rest (Figure 7F, Video 15).
336	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	2	6	Consistent with the effects of muscle 1 on more than one joint in the activation experiments (Figure 7D-E), the impaired retraction in silencing experiments could not be attributed to one specific joint (Figure 7G-H).
337	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	2	7	In sum, muscle 1 is a retractor, located in the rostrum but with additional effects on the haustellum.
338	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	3	1	The other two putative rostrum retractor muscles, m2D and m2V, also affected retraction, but more specifically for the rostrum.
339	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	3	2	They showed distinct roles; mn2V activation caused rostrum retraction from rest, whereas mn2D activation caused retraction from the extended position (Figure 7B,D).
340	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	3	3	Silencing mn2V caused a small impairment in how retracted the rostrum is at rest (Figure 7G).
341	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	3	4	Other silencing phenotypes for mn2V and mn2D were not observed (Figure 7F-H), suggesting that they may be at least partly redundant.
342	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	3	5	In sum, muscles 2D and 2V are accessory rostrum retractors.
343	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	3	6	Silencing the retractor muscles, 1, 2D or 2V, did not impair the extension of the rostrum or the haustellum during feeding, thus we conclude that these muscles are not required for proboscis extension (Figure 7I-J), only for retraction.
344	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	4	1	Combining these behavioral results with anatomical results, we propose a model of the action of the rostrum.
345	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	4	2	Imaging the rostrum in different positions shows that its extension correlates with the movement of an apodeme, a large part of cuticle within the rostrum (Figure 7P-Q, Video 16).
346	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	4	3	Only one point of the apodeme attaches to the external cuticle; this point forms the joint around which the rostrum rotates, seen in Video 1.
347	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	4	4	Muscle 9 causes rostrum protraction by anchoring on the head capsule and pulling on the free dorsal arm of the apodeme (via a tendon visible in Figure 6B), swinging it ventrally out of the head capsule.
348	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	4	5	To counteract this protraction, retraction is controlled by muscles 1, 2D and 2V, whose dorsal ends anchor on the head capsule, and whose ventral ends insert not on the apodeme, but on cuticle near its ventral end, where their contraction can draw the rostrum back into the head (and potentially aid haustellum retraction, discussed below).
349	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	4	6	Their role in rostrum retraction is supported by their decreased length in the retracted state, their decreased distance between sarcomeres (muscle striations) in the retracted state (consistent with contraction) (Figure 7P-Q), and by the behavioral results.
350	Results; Muscles that control rostrum movements	4	7	In sum, for the rostrum, we find evidence that muscle 9 controls protraction, and that three muscles control retraction (1, 2D, 2V).
351	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	1	1	With the above characterization of rostrum muscles, we then sought to describe the much less well understood haustellum.
352	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	1	2	Although it was affected by rostrum muscles described above, the haustellum can also move independently of the rostrum (Figure 2M-O, Video 4).
353	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	1	3	We determined that the muscle responsible for haustellum extension is the previously uncharacterized muscle 4; activation of mn4 elicited haustellum extension both from the rest position (Figure 8C,K,L, Figure 8-figure supplement 1A-B, Video 17) and from the extended position during feeding (Figure 8E), resulting in an overall change in proboscis position (Figure 8A).
354	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	1	4	(Raw angles available in Figure 7-figure supplement 2).
355	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	1	5	These activation phenotypes were specific to the haustellum, not affecting the rostrum (Figure 8B,D).
356	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	1	6	Silencing instead of activating mn4 caused a defect specific to haustellum extension during feeding (Figure 8F-J, Video 17).
357	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	1	7	Muscle 4 therefore shows both activation and silencing phenotypes for haustellum extension.
358	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	1	8	Since haustellum extension during feeding was virtually abolished by silencing mn4, its muscle may be the only one required for haustellum extension.
359	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	1	9	Although silencing mn9 also abolished haustellum extension, that may be because it also blocks rostrum extension, making haustellum extension more difficult mechanically.
360	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	2	1	In opposition to extension, we find that haustellum flexion is controlled by muscle 3.
361	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	2	2	Before behavioral testing, we stained 139 different combinations of split GAL4 lines to attempt to target mn3 (data not shown).
362	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	2	3	None cleanly targeted motor neurons for all fibers of muscle 3, but its lateral fibers and medial fibers could be separately targeted (Table 1).
363	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	2	4	(Muscles are often made up of multiple fibers; when only a single primary motor neuron controls that muscle, it branches to boutons on each muscle fiber.
364	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	2	5	We describe these lateral and medial fibers of m3 as one muscle since all have adjacent insertions and origins).
365	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	2	6	One split GAL4 line targeted the lateral fibers (mn3L) cleanly, with no other proboscis motor neurons present.
366	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	2	7	No lines cleanly targeted motor neurons for the medial fibers, thus we selected two imperfect lines, each of which targeted one additional proboscis motor neuron type, ‘mn3M&1’ and ‘mn3M&7’.
367	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	2	8	The function of muscle 3M could be inferred if a phenotype were found in both these lines, and not in both of the clean lines for the contaminating cell types (1 or 7).
368	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	3	1	Activating mn3 demonstrated that it acts as a haustellum flexor. mn3M&1, mn3M&7 and mn3L all triggered haustellum flexion during feeding (Figure 8E,M,N, Figure 8-figure supplement 1C-D, Video 18).
369	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	3	2	Although the contaminating cell type mn1 does so as well (Figure 7E), the contaminating mn7 does not (Figure 9N), suggesting that muscle 3 is responsible.
370	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	3	3	From the resting proboscis position, all mn3 lines could trigger additional proboscis retraction (Figure 8A), although that could not be attributed to a specific joint (Figure 8B-C).
371	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	3	4	As opposed to the effects on the haustellum, activation did not produce consistent effects on the rostrum (Figure 8D).
372	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	4	1	In silencing experiments, mn3M&1 and mn3M&7 both impaired proboscis retraction at rest (Figure 8F, Video 18).
373	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	4	2	Although the contaminating cell type mn1 does so as well (Figure 7F), the contaminating mn7 does not (Figure 9O), suggesting that muscle 3 is responsible.
374	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	4	3	Silencing mn3 lines otherwise did not produce consistent phenotypes (Figure 8F-J), possibly because mn3L and mn3M were not both targeted together.
375	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	4	4	In sum, by examining three different lines for mn3, we conclude that muscle 3 is a haustellum flexor.
376	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	5	1	Combining these behavioral results with anatomical results, we propose a model of the action of the haustellum.
377	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	5	2	Imaging the haustellum in different positions (Figure 8O-P) shows that its extension correlates with the rotation of a Y-shaped apodeme found within the joint.
378	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	5	3	Of the three arms of the Y, the ventroposterior arm was continuous with the external cuticle of the rostrum, the anterior arm was continuous with the external cuticle of the haustellum, and the dorsal arm was free.
379	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	5	4	We propose that a muscle pulling against the free dorsal arm could rotate the haustellum anteriorly away from the rostrum.
380	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	5	5	Indeed, we found that muscle 4 originates from a rigid part of the rostrum and inserts upon the free dorsal arm of the Y, where its contraction would cause rotation of the apodeme and thus haustellum extension.
381	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	5	6	Behavioral experiments above did show that muscle 4 was a haustellum extensor.
382	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	6	1	Another muscle, 2V, inserts upon the anterior arm (Figure 8O-P) where it could rotate the apodeme back in the other direction, dorsally.
383	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	6	2	This muscle showed no haustellum phenotype, but its insertion site is suggestive enough to bear further future investigation for a role in haustellum flexion, possibly masked here by muscle redundancy.
384	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	6	3	(Not included in Figure 8O-P is muscle 1, because although it had an activation phenotype on the haustellum (Figure 7E), this was possibly an indirect effect such as coupling, since there were no silencing effects and the muscle is not located in a position to control haustellum flexion).
385	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	6	4	Instead, another muscle, 3, was ideally located to act as a flexor (Figure 8O-P); coming from the anterior rostrum, it crosses the joint with the haustellum so that it could pull on the haustellum to fold it in towards the rostrum.
386	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	6	5	In behavioral experiments (above), muscle 3 indeed triggered haustellum flexion.
387	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	6	6	In sum, we find evidence that muscle 4 controls haustellum extension and that muscle 3 (possibly also 2V) controls flexion.
388	Results; Muscles that control haustellum movements	6	7	Indeed, based on distances between sarcomeres (Figure 8O-P), muscle 4 appears more contracted when the haustellum is more extended, and 2V and 3 appear more contracted when the haustellum is more flexed.
389	Results; Muscles that control labellar movements	1	1	The remaining two muscles (6 and 7) of the eight tested for roles in proboscis positioning were both found to insert upon on the lip-like labella (Figures 6B and 9A-C).
390	Results; Muscles that control labellar movements	1	2	Muscle 6 shows both activation and silencing phenotypes for labellar extension (Figure 9F,H, Video 19).
391	Results; Muscles that control labellar movements	1	3	Muscle 7 shows activation and silencing phenotypes for labellar abduction (the opening of the two lobes, Figure 9G,I, Video 20).
392	Results; Muscles that control labellar movements	1	4	Although mn7 activation also induced labellar extension (Figure 9F), that may be a side effect of abduction; muscle 7 showed no effect on labellar extension when silenced (Figure 9H).
393	Results; Muscles that control labellar movements	1	5	The line contaminated with mn7, mn3M&7, showed similar phenotypes to mn7 but at lower penetrance (Figure 9F-I), likely due to the fact that mn7 was not labeled in all flies of that line (Table 1).
394	Results; Muscles that control labellar movements	1	6	Muscle 6 and 7 are therefore the only muscles that showed labellar phenotypes.
395	Results; Muscles that control labellar movements	1	7	They showed certain effects on other proboscis movements (Figure 9J-S) which we interpret to be side effects, since they insert far from the rostrum or haustellum joints (Figure 9A).
396	Results; Muscles that control labellar movements	1	8	(Raw angles available in Figure 7-figure supplement 2).
397	Results; Muscles that control labellar movements	2	1	To summarize the behavioral results, all eight of the muscles predicted to be involved in proboscis positioning (based on the location of their insertion sites) indeed showed positioning phenotypes; six control reaching movements and two control the labella.
398	Results; Muscles that control labellar movements	2	2	Most of these findings (Table 3) were not previously known or, in some cases, differed from previous work (Schwarz et al., 2017).
399	Discussion	1	1	The present work describes the anatomy and function of motor neurons controlling each muscle of the fly proboscis.
400	Discussion	1	2	Building on previous studies in insects that have analyzed motor neurons in body parts such as the legs and proboscis (Baek and Mann, 2009; Brierley et al., 2012; Maniates-Selvin et al., 2020; Rajashekhar and Singh, 1994; Schwarz et al., 2017; Trimarchi and Schneiderman, 1994), we now provide the first comprehensive, genetically reproducible control of every primary motor neuron type for an appendage.
401	Discussion	1	3	We characterize the motor neurons’ outputs to musculature in the periphery and their dendrites in the brain.
402	Discussion	2	1	Detailed imaging of muscle insertion sites is used to predict that eight muscles participate in proboscis positioning, confirmed in behavioral experiments.
403	Discussion	2	2	With these tools, we produce a model of the function of the musculature and control of each proboscis joint, where a small number of motor neurons can produce a goal-directed reaching behavior.
404	Discussion	3	1	We consider the neurons of this collection to be primary excitatory motor neurons, as they do not resemble known modulatory motor neurons in adult flies, which are characterized by thin axons and small boutons on multiple muscles (Rivlin et al., 2004).
405	Discussion	3	2	Likewise, they do not resemble inhibitory motor neurons found in several arthropods, which mostly innervate multiple muscles (Wolf, 2014).
406	Discussion	3	3	Anatomical and behavioral evidence supports the identity of these neurons as primary motor neurons.
407	Discussion	4	1	The split GAL4 combinations used here to target motor neurons were nicely sparse but not perfect, often containing some neurons in other brain regions.
408	Discussion	4	2	However, they are quite specific in the SEZ, where we think much of the motor circuitry of the proboscis will be found.
409	Discussion	4	3	Triple intersections with SEZ-specific reagents based on Hox expression (Simpson, 2016) could be used for further restricting expression.
410	Discussion	4	4	Future work must also examine the cooperative action of multiple motor neurons, rather than just their effects in isolation.
411	Discussion	5	1	Computational brain alignment suggests that motor neuron dendrites are not found in close proximity to several known cell types involved in feeding.
412	Discussion	5	2	Unknown circuit layers between sensory and motor neurons likely aid with functions such as pattern generation or command-like roles.
413	Discussion	5	3	Although certain mechanosensory neurons have been investigated in the proboscis (Zhou et al., 2019), the role of sensory feedback in proboscis reaching remains to be explored; the approach used here could also be applied to the isolation of proprioceptive neurons.
414	Discussion	6	1	With this motor neuron collection, we provide a description of the muscles that act at each proboscis joint.
415	Discussion	6	2	It extends previous efforts (Schwarz et al., 2017) by using a stronger neuronal silencer to find silencing phenotypes for more cell types (Table 3), tissue clearing techniques that show more neurons than were thought to be present in GAL4 lines (Table 2), and split GAL4 lines for more specificity.
416	Discussion	6	3	While the kinematics of proboscis reaching remains to be explored, the comprehensive genetic tools we describe provide the means to do so.
417	Discussion	7	1	We discover unexpected complexity of phenotypes from rostrum motor neurons.
418	Discussion	7	2	Both mn9 and mn1 are located near the rostrum, not in a position to control the haustellum directly, yet showed phenotypic effects on the haustellum as well.
419	Discussion	7	3	These may represent examples of biomechanical coupling.
420	Discussion	7	4	We were struck by how common ‘side effects’ like this were - another example is that, although mn7 is responsible for labellar abduction (with both activation and silencing phenotypes), its activation also triggers labellar extension.
421	Discussion	7	5	We speculate that optogenetically forcing the movement of one body part may cause a fly to move another in response, even if the activated motor neuron is not directly involved in the latter at all, or that forced movement about a joint may cause afferent feedback that leads to activation of other motor neurons.
422	Discussion	7	6	Intrinsic biomechanical properties, such as passive joint forces, are also known to provide non-neural (and rapid) aid during motor responses to mechanical perturbations, for example in cockroach, locust and stick insect legs during locomotion (Ache and Matheson, 2013; Jindrich and Full, 2002).
423	Discussion	8	1	These possible side effects of optogenetic activation highlight the utility of combining activation and silencing data to deduce muscle roles, since both methods can have pitfalls (Yoshihara and Yoshihara, 2018).
424	Discussion	8	2	By incorporating activation, silencing, and insertion site data, we derive interpretations of muscle roles (Table 3) that differ in several respects from those of a previous work based mainly on activation (Schwarz et al., 2017).
425	Discussion	9	1	It will be of interest to determine how flexibility is achieved in the recruitment of proboscis muscles.
426	Discussion	9	2	Several muscles were innervated by only a single primary motor neuron, but in the case where two were present, it is possible that they control slow twitch and fast twitch fibers, as found in both the fly (Azevedo et al., 2019) and in mammalian muscle, to fine-tune the strength of a muscle response.
427	Discussion	9	3	Regardless, the dramatic numerical simplicity of only one or two primary motor neurons per muscle in flies presents an experimental advantage for future circuit studies.
428	Discussion	9	4	Given that the proboscis has a varied repertoire of movements in feeding and courtship (Manzo et al., 2012; McKellar et al., 2019), one exciting avenue would be to decipher the circuit logic of how different movements with multiple behavioral functions can arise from these few motor neurons.
429	Discussion	9	5	Activation and inactivation experiments of individual proboscis motor neuron types support a model of separable control, enabling articulated movements that allow flexibility.
430	Discussion	10	1	Directed reaching occurs in different forms: humans show sophisticated, learned arm and hand movements (Parker, 1974), yet newborns show a more basic, innate form of intentional reaching (Bower et al., 1970).
431	Discussion	10	2	In primates, work on the neural coding of goal-directed behavior has often focused on how its features might be encoded by firing properties of single neurons or single brain areas, particularly within the cerebral cortex (Kalaska, 2019).
432	Discussion	10	3	Forms of reaching exist in smaller animals such as rodents and cephalopods (Gutnick et al., 2011; Peterson, 1934).
433	Discussion	10	4	We propose that proboscis reaching in flies could present a new model for understanding the neural circuit basis of goal-directed movement.
434	Discussion	10	5	Drosophila has rich behavior, a smaller nervous system, and powerful genetic tools.
435	Discussion	10	6	Additionally, a whole-brain synaptic connectome is underway (see flywire.ai, based on the images of Zheng et al., 2017) that can help map how diverse interneurons may converge upon this small set of motor neurons to produce a repertoire of flexible motor behaviors from a single appendage.
436	Materials and methods; Terminology	1	1	The area formerly known as the sub(o)esophageal ganglion (SOG/SEG) is now called the gnathal ganglion (Ito et al., 2014).
437	Materials and methods; Terminology	1	2	The gnathal ganglion, however, does not encompass the whole area ventral to the esophageal foramen, the subesophageal zone (SEZ).
438	Materials and methods; Terminology	1	3	We use the term SEZ because the motor neurons described here are not confined to the gnathal ganglion, but are all within the larger area of the SEZ.
439	Materials and methods; Terminology	2	1	The axis system used is that of the body axis (Ito et al., 2014).
440	Materials and methods; Terminology	2	2	During feeding the proboscis mostly extends ventrally toward the surface the fly is standing on, so the head is dorsal, the tip of the proboscis ventral, with the maxillary palps on the anterior surface.
441	Materials and methods; Fly stocks and rearing	1	1	The GAL4-UAS system was used to direct gene expression to defined populations of cells (Brand and Perrimon, 1993).
442	Materials and methods; Fly stocks and rearing	1	2	The split GAL4 system (Luan et al., 2006; Pfeiffer et al., 2010) was used to express the activation domain (AD) and the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of GAL4 under the separate control of two genomic enhancers, to obtain the intersection of their expression patterns, with the goal of obtaining a sparser pattern.
443	Materials and methods; Fly stocks and rearing	1	3	GAL4, split GAL4 and LexA stocks were gifts of Gerald Rubin and Barry Dickson (Jenett et al., 2012; Pfeiffer et al., 2010; Tirian and Dickson, 2017).
444	Materials and methods; Fly stocks and rearing	1	4	GAL4s and DBDs were inserted into the landing site attP2; ADs and LexAs were inserted into attP40.
445	Materials and methods; Fly stocks and rearing	1	5	Other lines used were: wildtype: Canton S ‘A’ (a gift of Jeff Hall), GFP: pJFRC2-10x-UAS-IVS-mCD8::GFP in su(Hw)attP5 (Pfeiffer et al., 2010), CsChrimson: 20XUAS-CsChrimson-mCherry (Klapoetke et al., 2014) in su(Hw)attP5, TNT: UAS-TeTxLC.TNT (Sweeney et al., 1995), eye mechanosensory neurons: VT017251-LexA (Hampel et al., 2017), Hugin: HUGS3-GAL4 (Melcher and Pankratz, 2005), sweet taste neurons: Gr64f-GAL4 [737-5];Gr64f-GAL4 [737-1] (Dahanukar et al., 2007), bitter taste neurons: Gr66a-GAL4 (II) (Dunipace et al., 2001), Fdg neurons: NP883-GAL4 and NP5137-GAL4 (Flood et al., 2013), multicolor flipout stochastic labelling: pBPhsFlp2::PEST in attP3;; pJFRC201-10XUAS-FRT > STOP > FRT-myr::smGFP-HA in VK00005, pJFRC240-10XUAS-FRT > STOP > FRT-myr::smGFP-V5-THS-10XUAS-FRT > STOP > FRT-myr::smGFP-FLAG in su(Hw)attP1 (Nern et al., 2015).
446	Materials and methods; Fly stocks and rearing	1	6	All transgenes were in a w1118 background.
447	Materials and methods; Fly stocks and rearing	1	7	Behavior experiments used flies with a wildtype X chromosome to permit normal vision.
448	Materials and methods; Fly stocks and rearing	2	1	Experiments were carried out on 3-7 day old heterozygote males.
449	Materials and methods; Fly stocks and rearing	2	2	Controls omitted either the GAL4 driver or the UAS effector; for example, for TNT experiments on mn9, the two controls were the mn9 split GAL4 combination with no UAS-TeTxLC.TNT (‘split control’) and UAS-TeTxLC.TNT with no split GAL4 (‘TNT control’).
450	Materials and methods; Fly stocks and rearing	2	3	Flies were raised at 25°C and 50% relative humidity on standard cornmeal and molasses food in a 12 hr light/dark cycle, except for flies for CsChrimson experiments, which were dark-reared on food containing 0.2 mM all-trans retinal (Toronto Research Chemical, #R240000).
451	Materials and methods; Fly stocks and rearing	2	4	Behavioral experiments were performed at 25°C, 40% humidity.
452	Materials and methods; Fly stocks and rearing	2	5	When needed before experiments, anesthesia was performed on ice.
453	Materials and methods; Synchrotron	1	1	Flies were tethered under cold anesthesia and filmed at 3000 fps with an x-ray beam in the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron at the Argonne National Laboratory.
454	Materials and methods; Synchrotron	1	2	Proboscis extension was filmed during rare instances when it occurred spontaneously.
455	Materials and methods; CNS immunohistochemistry and imaging	1	1	Brains and ventral nervous systems were dissected and stained using published methods (Nern et al., 2015).
456	Materials and methods; CNS immunohistochemistry and imaging	1	2	Antibodies: rabbit anti-GFP (1:500, Invitrogen, #A11122), mouse anti-Bruchpilot (1:50, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa, mAb nc82), Alexa Fluor 488-goat anti-rabbit (1:500, ThermoFisher A11034), Alexa Fluor 568-goat anti-mouse (1:500, ThermoFisher A11031).
457	Materials and methods; CNS immunohistochemistry and imaging	1	3	Serial optical sections were obtained at 1 µm intervals on a Zeiss 700 confocal with a Plan-Apochromat 20x/0.8NA objective.
458	Materials and methods; Preparation of whole mount heads for muscle and cuticle imaging	1	1	Flies were anesthetized with CO_2 and briefly washed with 70% ethanol.
459	Materials and methods; Preparation of whole mount heads for muscle and cuticle imaging	1	2	Antennae, maxillary palps, eye cups (including retinas) and a small part of labellum were removed from isolated heads under 2% paraformaldehyde/PBS/0.1% triton X-100.
460	Materials and methods; Preparation of whole mount heads for muscle and cuticle imaging	1	3	Heads were fixed in this solution overnight at 4°C, then incubated in PBS with 1% triton X-100, 0.5% DMSO and Escin (0.05 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, E1378) containing Texas Red-X Phalloidin (1:50, Life Technologies #T7471) and a chitin-binding dye Calcofluor White (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich #F3543-1G) at room temperature with agitation for up to 5 days.
461	Materials and methods; Preparation of whole mount heads for muscle and cuticle imaging	1	4	Long incubation times and the presence of surfactants assured better penetration of phalloidin into the muscles.
462	Materials and methods; Preparation of whole mount heads for muscle and cuticle imaging	1	5	The samples were then washed in PBS/1% triton (4 × 1 hr) and fixed for 4 hr in 2% paraformaldehyde to reduce leaching of bound phalloidin from muscles during the subsequent ethanol dehydration step.
463	Materials and methods; Preparation of whole mount heads for muscle and cuticle imaging	1	6	To avoid artefacts caused by osmotic shrinkage of soft tissue, samples were gradually dehydrated in glycerol (2-80%) and then ethanol (20% to 100%) (Ott, 2008) and mounted in methyl salicylate (Sigma-Aldrich #M6752) for imaging.
464	Materials and methods; Preparation of head sections for muscle and cuticle imaging	1	1	Heads were prepared as described above, washed, embedded in 7% agarose (SeaKem, Lonza #50002) in PBS and sectioned sagittally on a vibratome (Leica VT1000s) at 0.3 mm.
465	Materials and methods; Preparation of head sections for muscle and cuticle imaging	1	2	The slices were incubated with Texas Red-X Phalloidin and Calcofluor (solution composition as above) for 2 days at room temperature, washed and mounted in Tris-buffered (50 mM, pH 8.4) 50% glycerol.
466	Materials and methods; Preparation of head sections for muscle and cuticle imaging	1	3	To image cuticle alone, soft tissues were digested away after imaging, with 0.25 mg/ml collagenase/dispase (Roche #10269638001) and 0.25 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma Aldrich #H3884) in PBS for 5 hr at 37°C.
467	Materials and methods; Preparation of head sections for muscle and cuticle imaging	1	4	After washing, exoskeleton was stained with Congo Red (0.5 mg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich #C676), washed and mounted in buffered glycerol.
468	Materials and methods; Preparation of head sections for muscle and cuticle imaging	1	5	Serial optical sections were obtained at 1 µm intervals on a Zeiss 500 or 710 confocal microscopes with a LD-LCI 25x/0.8 NA objective.
469	Materials and methods; Preparation of head sections for muscle and cuticle imaging	1	6	Congo Red was imaged using a 594 nm laser.
470	Materials and methods; Whole mount head staining for synapse, muscle and GFP imaging	1	1	Type I, II and III boutons all express the presynaptic protein Bruchpilot (Wagh et al., 2006), so it was chosen here as a pan-synaptic marker for neuromuscular junctions.
471	Materials and methods; Whole mount head staining for synapse, muscle and GFP imaging	1	2	Heads were prepared as above, except fixation time was reduced to 2 hr due to the sensitivity of Bruchpilot epitopes to prolonged fixation.
472	Materials and methods; Whole mount head staining for synapse, muscle and GFP imaging	1	3	The heads were incubated in PBS with aforementioned surfactants and 3% goat serum (Life Technologies #776318), Alexa Fluor 633 Phalloidin (1:50, Life Technologies # A22284), rabbit anti-GFP polyclonal (1:1000, Thermo Fisher, #A10262) and mouse anti-Bruchpilot mouse monoclonal antibodies (1:50 [concentrate]; DSHB/Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, mAb nc82) at room temperature with agitation for 5 days.
473	Materials and methods; Whole mount head staining for synapse, muscle and GFP imaging	1	4	After a series of four ~ 1 hr washes in PBS containing surfactants, the sections were incubated for another 24 hr in the above buffer containing secondary antibodies (1:1000, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit, Thermo Fisher #A32731; 1:250 Cy3 goat anti-mouse, Jackson Immunoresearch #115-166-003).
474	Materials and methods; Whole mount head staining for synapse, muscle and GFP imaging	1	5	Samples were washed, post-fixed, dehydrated and cleared for imaging as described above.
475	Materials and methods; Whole mount head staining for synapse, muscle and GFP imaging	1	6	Serial optical sections were obtained at 1 µm intervals on a Zeiss 500 or 710 confocal microscopes with a LD-LCI 25x/0.8 NA objective.
476	Materials and methods; Whole mount head staining for synapse, muscle and GFP imaging	1	7	Calcofluor White, anti-GFP/anti-rabbit Alexa 488 antibodies, anti-nc82/anti-mouse Cy3 antibodies, Congo Red, Texas Red and Alexa 633 phalloidin-treated samples were imaged using 405, 488, 561, 594 and 633 nm lasers, respectively.
477	Materials and methods; Stochastic labeling	1	1	For multicolor flipout stochastic labeling, flies received a 15 min heat shock at 37°C at 1-3 d old, and were dissected at 6-8 d.
478	Materials and methods; Stochastic labeling	1	2	Dissections were performed to carefully remove the brain from the head but preserve both for staining, so that an individually labeled neuron in the brain could be correlated with its projections to the muscle.
479	Materials and methods; Stochastic labeling	1	3	Staining was performed as described (Nern et al., 2015), with the following antibodies: rat anti-flag (Novus Biologicals, LLC, Littleton, CO, #NBP1-06712), rabbit anti-HA (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, #3724S), mouse anti-V5 (AbD Serotec, Kidlington, England, #MCA1360), AlexaFluor-488 (1:500; goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-chicken, goat anti-mouse; Thermo Fisher Scientific), AlexaFluor-568 (1:500; goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rat; Thermo Fisher Scientific), AlexaFluor-633 (1:500; goat anti-rat; Thermo Fisher Scientific).
480	Materials and methods; Image processing	1	1	Images were adjusted for gain and contrast without obscuring data.
481	Materials and methods; Image processing	1	2	Images were processed in ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/), Icy (http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/) and Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc).
482	Materials and methods; Image processing	1	3	Where noted, motor neurons and muscles were rendered and segmented from confocal stacks with VVDviewer software (https://github.com/takashi310/VVD_Viewer), to visualize them in isolation.
483	Materials and methods; Image processing	1	4	For this rendering and for computational alignment of brain images used where noted, brain images were registered using the Computational Morphometry Toolkit (http://nitrc.org/projects/cmtk) (Jefferis et al., 2007), to a standard brain template (‘JFRC2014’) mounted and imaged with the same conditions, which had been corrected by a z scaling factor of 1.568 to match the true proportions of a fly brain (obtained from frontal vs. horizontal stacks of the brain [Ito et al., 2014]).
484	Materials and methods; Occupancy experiments	1	1	Head staining (described above) was used to determine whether the collection included every primary motor neuron of the proboscis.
485	Materials and methods; Occupancy experiments	1	2	To be sure that every axon terminal was accounted for, we stained each motor neuron line one by one, and inspected every bouton in the 3D stack.
486	Materials and methods; Occupancy experiments	1	3	All the boutons on the relevant muscle were indeed completely occupied by the labeled motor neurons.
487	Materials and methods; Occupancy experiments	1	4	The lack of unoccupied boutons suggests that modulatory motor neurons’ boutons in the proboscis may not be labeled by the synaptic marker used here, or may not be visible as separate punctae since modulatory boutons can lie directly on top of primary motor neuron terminals (Rivlin et al., 2004).
488	Materials and methods; Occupancy experiments	1	5	Incomplete occupancy of the boutons of muscle 3 was to be expected, since no line could be found to cover all its motor neurons, so separate lines were used that targeted muscle 3’s medial and lateral fibers.
489	Materials and methods; Occupancy experiments	1	6	For muscle 10, a bilateral motor neuron pair was never observed in 6 stained heads, only a single unilateral neuron that could be found in either hemisphere.
490	Materials and methods; Occupancy experiments	1	7	Since it did not occupy all boutons on muscle 10, we infer that it is not an unpaired neuron, but stochastic expression in a pair of motor neurons.
491	Materials and methods; Cameras and lighting	1	1	Behavior was filmed with Basler A622f cameras at 30 Hz, controlled by gVision software developed at Janelia (Gus Lott).
492	Materials and methods; Cameras and lighting	1	2	Ambient lighting was provided by white light, or by two infrared security spotlights (Phenas) for CsChrimson experiments.
493	Materials and methods; Cameras and lighting	1	3	For CsChrimson activation, a 656 nm LED spotlight (Mightex PLS-0656-101 C) was controlled through a NIDAQ board and Labview software (National Instruments, Austin, TX).
494	Materials and methods; Cameras and lighting	1	4	An 880 nm infrared LED (Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation #QEE123) was connected to a fiber optic in the field of view, to indicate when the stimulus was on, since a long-pass 830 nm filter in front of the camera prevented the stimulus light from obscuring the behavior video.
495	Materials and methods; Cameras and lighting	1	5	Each stimulus was 2 s of constant light at 100 µW/mm^2.
496	Materials and methods; Freely moving behavior	1	1	To compare proboscis extension during feeding vs. courtship, flies were placed in oval chambers, 3 mm high, 9 mm wide and 12 mm long, to provide a flat segment along the wall in which to film proboscis extension from the side.
497	Materials and methods; Freely moving behavior	1	2	For feeding, wildtype males were starved with access to water for 24 hr, then loaded into chambers with 10% sucrose/2% agarose painted onto a segment of the wall.
498	Materials and methods; Freely moving behavior	1	3	Proboscis angles were scored in the frame of greatest proboscis extension during one proboscis extension event (event = time from extension to retraction), in events where the fly was orthogonal to the camera, contacting the sucrose on the wall.
499	Materials and methods; Freely moving behavior	1	4	Courtship was filmed in chambers of the same dimensions but with a virgin female present.
500	Materials and methods; Freely moving behavior	1	5	Proboscis extension was likewise scored in the frame of maximum extension, in courtship licking events occurring when the male was orthogonal to the camera and directly behind the female on the flat segment of wall.
501	Materials and methods; Tethered fly behavior	1	1	Flies were anesthetized using cold, and mounted by the thorax to a pin with UV-cured glue (LED-200 UV gun, Electro-Lite Corp.).
502	Materials and methods; Tethered fly behavior	1	2	The same glue was used in experiments in which proboscis segments were glued.
503	Materials and methods; Tethered fly behavior	1	3	Mounted flies were allowed to recover for a few minutes before CsChrimson stimulation experiments, or alternatively were deprived of food and water for 5 hr before sucrose presentation experiments.
504	Materials and methods; Tethered fly behavior	2	1	For sucrose presentation, a small 100 mM sucrose droplet was presented to the legs from a syringe on a manipulator, holding the target at a distance that prevents proboscis contact.
505	Materials and methods; Tethered fly behavior	2	2	The proboscis is extended repeatedly in search of the sucrose, moving through a range of angles (Video 7).
506	Materials and methods; Tethered fly behavior	2	3	The legs are not in contact with the ground and wave almost continuously, therefore rapidly encounter the sucrose.
507	Materials and methods; Tethered fly behavior	2	4	The proboscis reaching is guided not by vision but by leg contact, since the assay is performed under infrared illumination not visible to the fly.
508	Materials and methods; Tethered fly behavior	2	5	Visually-guided proboscis reaching was never observed in these conditions; the proboscis never extended before the legs tasted the sucrose.
509	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	1	1	Joint angles for the head, rostrum and haustellum were measured from individual video frames in ImageJ by marking the points shown in Figure 2C-D.
510	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	1	2	The rostrum angle is closer to 180° than 0° at rest, so is expressed as subtracted from 180° so that values are smaller at rest than during proboscis extension.
511	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	1	3	When the haustellum is drawn into the head, its angle cannot be directly measured, but can be extrapolated by trigonometry, using the law of cosines with the distance from the rostrum joint to the end of the haustellum, and assuming that the rostrum and haustellum lengths are fixed proportions of the measured size of the head.
512	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	2	1	Measures of joint angles were chosen to best suit each assay.
513	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	2	2	Due to the challenge of gluing flies to pins manually, the camera view varied, leading to variability in the measured raw angles of the joints.
514	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	2	3	To overcome this variability, within-fly normalization was performed wherever possible, subtracting food- or CsChrimson-stimulated extension angle from the angle immediately before stimulation.
515	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	2	4	Note that normalization was not possible for resting state angles, since there is no change from baseline.
516	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	2	5	Analysis of raw joint angles (Figure 7-figure supplement 2) shows similar relations between motor neurons and joint angles as the normalized data but with greater inter-fly variability, as expected from the range of starting positions, so the main figures use normalized values as follows.
517	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	2	6	Wildtype joint angles (Figure 2M-O) were measured in the frame 200 ms after the beginning of proboscis movement elicited by sucrose.
518	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	2	7	For CsChrimson stimulation from rest, angles were measured in the frame of maximal proboscis movement during the stimulus and subtracted from the frame before the stimulus to report change in angle.
519	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	2	8	For CsChrimson stimulation during ongoing feeding, angles were measured in the frame 200 ms after the stimulus start and subtracted from the frame before the stimulus.
520	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	2	9	For TNT silencing, angles were measured at rest (where noted in figures), or during feeding (as the difference in angle from the start of proboscis extension to 200 ms later).
521	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	2	10	During CsChrimson activation from rest, proboscis change is total extension of proboscis (farthest point on back of head to tip of labellum) at maximum movement divided by at rest (frame before stimulus).
522	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	3	1	During TNT silencing, proboscis position provides a measure of how retracted the proboscis is at rest, and is measured as the distance from back of head to tip of labellum divided by this value averaged across controls, after first normalizing the size of the fly (using measured height of head).
523	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	3	2	Labellar extension and abduction were quantified as binary values, occurring or not occurring.
524	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	4	1	The angle of the sucrose target was measured from a line along the posterior-anterior axis of the fly (drawn from a point on the thorax marked by the humeral bristles, to the center of the eye), in the first frame of leg contact with the sucrose.
525	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	4	2	A target at 90°=directly ventral to the eye.
526	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	5	1	Mean reach angle was measured by creating a stack in ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) of the trial video frames, and generating an average intensity projection, creating a cloud of pixels where the proboscis had moved.
527	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	5	2	In the region where the proboscis tip had moved, the pixel of maximum brightness was taken as the mean location of the tip over the trial.
528	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	5	3	Mean reach angle was calculated from this proboscis tip location, with respect to a line along the posterior-anterior axis of the fly (drawn from the humeral bristles to the center of the eye).
529	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	6	1	To determine the accuracy of reaching, aim deviation was calculated as mean reach angle minus target angle, so that a deviation above 0° would represent reaching above the target in the dorsoventral plane, and aim below 0° would be below.
530	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	6	2	Physical constraints may affect aim; flies appear to reach too high to low targets, and too low to high targets (Figure 2L).
531	Materials and methods; Proboscis, head and target angle measurements	6	3	For proboscis reaching in wildtype flies (Figure 2), occasional flies were excluded if they did not appear hungry after the deprivation period (no proboscis extension to sucrose).
532	Materials and methods; Speed, velocity, length and distance measurements	1	1	Points were manually drawn on video frames in ImageJ to acquire coordinates, which were converted to lengths by basic trigonometry.
533	Materials and methods; Speed, velocity, length and distance measurements	1	2	Frame 1 was taken to be the frame of the first rapid acceleration of the proboscis after sucrose contact.
534	Materials and methods; Speed, velocity, length and distance measurements	1	3	Target location was taken to be site of leg contact with sucrose in most recent frame of contact before proboscis extension.
535	Materials and methods; Speed, velocity, length and distance measurements	1	4	Reach speed = distance proboscis tip traveled per ms (involving both proboscis and/or head motion, in any direction).
536	Materials and methods; Speed, velocity, length and distance measurements	1	5	Proboscis velocity = tip displacement towards target minus head displacement towards target, per ms.
537	Materials and methods; Speed, velocity, length and distance measurements	1	6	Proboscis length = distance from rostrum joint to tip, subtracting mean length at start to set starting length to zero.
538	Materials and methods; Speed, velocity, length and distance measurements	1	7	Proboscis distance from target = distance from tip to target.
539	Materials and methods; Statistical information	1	1	Experiments were blinded for scoring by assigning random identifications and only unblinding after all scoring.
540	Materials and methods; Statistical information	1	2	T-tests were two-tailed.
541	Materials and methods; Statistical information	1	3	Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were first used to confirm that the data were consistent with a normal distribution.
542	Materials and methods; Statistical information	1	4	Error bars are standard error of the mean (SEM).
543	Materials and methods; Statistical information	1	5	In jitter plots, horizontal bars represent the mean.
544	Materials and methods; Statistical information	1	6	Outliers were not excluded.
545	Materials and methods; Statistical information	1	7	Sample size and other statistical information is provided in each relevant figure legend or Methods section.
546	Materials and methods; Statistical information	1	8	Asterisks: *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, N.S.: not significant.
547	Materials and methods; Statistical information	1	9	All replicates are biological, testing different flies, not retesting the same individuals as technical replicates.
548	Materials and methods; Statistical information	1	10	Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction used a false discovery rate of 0.1, and was applied across every genotype tested (across all motor neuron testing figures).
549	Materials and methods; Statistical information	1	11	In comparing mean reach angle to high and low targets, an a priori power analysis was performed in G*Power software using an effect size of 0.7 (estimated from a pilot study), an alpha error probability of 0.05, one tail, and a power of 0.8, giving a required sample size of 28 per group.
