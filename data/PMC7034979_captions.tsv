123	figure	Figure 5	3	By comparing the single cell cluster sizes to the true abundance of each cell type (estimated as described in the Materials and methods) we found that the scRNA-seq map can both under- and over-estimate the abundance of each cell type (assuming accurate cell type labels), or that the cell type is incorrectly assigned (i.e. contains different or additional cell types).
124	figure	Figure 5	4	To estimate the true cell count, we made use of known anatomy (for example, several cell types are known to be present exactly once in each of the ~2×750 medulla columns per brain) or relied on published counts.
