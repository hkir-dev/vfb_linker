1	figure	Figure 1	1	The Dorsal Accessory Calyx of the Drosophila melanogaster Mushroom Body as Defined by the Claw-Shaped Dendrites of the α/βp Kenyon Cells (A) A schematic of the Drosophila brain shows three types of Kenyon cell associated with the different mushroom body calyces: the α/βp Kenyon cells (dark gray, left) extend their claw-shaped dendrites in the dorsal accessory calyx (dACA); the α/βs (medium gray, right)—as well as the α’/β’ap, α’/β’m, and γmain Kenyon cells (not depicted)—extend their claw-shaped dendrites in the main calyx (CA); and the γd Kenyon cells (light gray, left) extend their claw-shaped dendrites in the ventral accessory calyx (vACA).
2	figure	Figure 1	2	All Kenyon cells extend their axons along one or two lobes (arrowheads).
3	figure	Figure 1	3	(B and C) A single α/βp (B) or α/βs (C) Kenyon cell (white) of the mushroom body (red) was photo-labeled; (B) the photo-labeled α/βp Kenyon cell extends claw-shaped dendritic terminals (arrows) in the dACA (white dashed outline), but not in the vACA (white dashed outline) or CA (not outlined); (C) the photo-labeled α/βs Kenyon cell extends claw-shaped dendritic terminals (arrows) in the CA (white dashed outline) but not in the dACA or the vACA (not outlined).
4	figure	Figure 1	4	(D) The dACA is loose and irregularly shaped, but its core can be visualized in the red channel.
5	figure	Figure 1	5	(E) α/βp Kenyon cells (n = 13) form smaller claws than the α/βs Kenyon cells (n = 12).

17	figure	Figure 3	2	(B and C) First, the expression patterns of each of the transgenic lines available in the FlyLight database were inspected: transgenic lines clearly driving expression strongly (B; R19H07-GAL4) or weakly (C; R44H11-GAL4) in neurons projecting to or from the dACA (white dashed outline) were selected for further investigation.
18	figure	Figure 3	3	These images were obtained from the FlyLight website.
19	figure	Figure 3	4	(D and E) The dACA (white dashed outline) of the mushroom body (red) was visualized in the selected lines, here R19H07-GAL4, and targeted for photo-activation by designing a mask that exposed the outlined region to high-energy light; transgenic lines driving expression in a few neurons extending clear axonal terminals in the dACA (E, arrow) were selected for further investigation.
