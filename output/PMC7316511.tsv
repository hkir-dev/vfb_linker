PMC7316511	Discussion	7	5	motor neuron	FBbt:00001564	U neuron	U motor neuron,FBbt:00001564,U/CQ neuron	1.0	We speculate that optogenetically forcing the movement of one body part may cause a fly to move another in response, even if the activated motor neuron is not directly involved in the latter at all, or that forced movement about a joint may cause afferent feedback that leads to activation of other motor neurons.
